#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=0) |  JOHN MUELLER: All right, welcome, everyone, to

today's Webmaster Central office hours hangout. My name is John Mueller. I am a webmaster trends analyst here at Google in Switzerland. And part of what we do are these office hours hangouts, where webmasters, publishers, SEOs can jump in and ask a lot of their questions, at least the ones related to web search. As always, if any of you want to get started with the first question, feel free to jump on in.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=30) |  ANATOLII: I can start. JOHN MUELLER: All

right. ANATOLII: You know, I've watched interesting video from Martin Splitt, this new episode-- first episode about SEO [INAUDIBLE].. It was interesting. And you know, he talked about three-- the most important factors where webmasters need to pay more attention. It's content, performance, and metainformation.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=60) |  Yeah, I understand about content. You need

to have the best content in the world and the best performance to satisfy-- I don't know-- all problems and decide all those problems. But what about metainformation? Sometimes I can see that Google doesn't understand correctly. And you know, sometimes I don't understand how Google see this content. Because it's short title, you know, 60 symbols, I think,  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=90) |  like this one, and 160 symbols for

description. And how Google combine end user intention with this short information? Because Google don't need to-- doesn't need to show more information on Google search result, because people scan. They don't need to read. Yeah, just it's enough. But you know, I need to use exact keywords, or I need to reply some questions only  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=120) |  in this short information. Can you give

me more details? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I don't know. I think it's always tricky when you have something like top three ranking factors, because things change so quickly. And they vary from query to query. And they vary over time. So I think the-- I'm not exactly sure how Martin framed it in his videos. But essentially, some of these things  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=150) |  are more relevant for some kinds of

developers than others in the sense that, a lot of times, web developers, when we talk to them, they're not aware of things like metadescriptions, metatitles, and things like that being that critical. And they don't make sure that they're visible, for example, if they're using a single page app, if they're using a JavaScript framework, those kind of things, which is why we're explicitly calling some of these factors out in these videos when we're  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=180) |  talking specifically for an audience of developers

like that. So that's kind of where I think that's coming from-- when we're talking specifically for an audience of developers like that. So I wouldn't necessarily say that every website only needs to focus on those factors, and then everything  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=210) |  will be perfect. It's rather more that

these are things that we've commonly seen being missed by people who are making websites like that. ANATOLII: What about-- do I need to use exact keyword? Or I think right brain understands my concerns and title if it's clickable title for users. But sometimes I think Google are confused in terms of my title,  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=240) |  yeah. And a few times, I rewrote

title. It used just a simple keyword. Perhaps people understand, better, this title. And yeah, Google, after this, [INAUDIBLE].. But it's not clickable like first variant. It means it's better to-- or it depends on situation. JOHN MUELLER: I think it depends. I think it's something that makes sense to try out,  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=270) |  especially if you're unsure. If people understand

what your pages are about, then try a different title. I've also seen people sometimes use ads to try that out where you can try it out a little bit faster, and where you can explicitly specify a title and a description that you want to have shown, and see how users react to that. So that might be another approach. In general, we do understand synonyms. We do understand general topics, things that you're  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=300) |  talking about on your pages. So you

don't need to go out and put all variations of all keywords exactly the way, on your pages, as people might search for them. But of course, you do need to be explicit on your pages and say, this is a page about-- I don't know-- some specific car type, for example, rather than a generic page where you're saying, oh, this was a blast, and you have all of these wordings on your page. And nobody can really tell, are you talking about a car?  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=330) |  Are you trying to sell a car?

Is this a review about a car? What, explicitly, are you trying to talk about? So that's something where I do sometimes see sites kind of drift off into the direction of creating really fancy content that looks really nice. But for users and for search engines, it's sometimes really hard to understand what it is that they're really trying to say, or what they're trying to offer to people.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=360) |  I think, for the most part, SEOs

get this right, because they think about the keywords a lot more. But especially, small businesses, if they don't have someone who's really thinking about what queries might people be searching for to land on these pages, they tend to drift off into the direction of creating pages that look really nice but don't work that well for search. Because they don't mention what it is that they're really about. ANATOLII: OK, thank you.  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=390) |  BARRY: John, I have two questions, one

about the mobile-first indexing and one about favicons. JOHN MUELLER: OK. BARRY: Let's start with favicons. It seems to me that if you remove a favicon because it's violating the guidelines, the favicon guidelines, that it's similar to a manual action when you remove, I guess, rich results or rich snippets for violating rich snippet guidelines. Right now, it's very new. People are playing games and testing things.  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=420) |  And you guys remove stuff. Are there

going to be manual actions via search console about removals with favicons? Are there any discussions? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. It's possible. But I think it kind of depends on what all happens there and how that plays out. To a large part, these things are meant to be handled in an algorithmic way in the sense that, if we can algorithmically figure out that this is an image that is against our guidelines,  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=450) |  then we can just filter it out.

And then when you update your favicon file and we see that, oh, it has changed, then that's something that we could algorithmically pick up and say, oh, it's different now. We'll double-check it with our guidelines. And if it's OK, then we'll just let it go. So in general, my preference would be to have something that just works automatically so that you don't have to do any kind of manual action and manual-review-type process.  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=480) |  But I don't know. We'll see how

things work out. BARRY: All right, currently, right now, it's not automated. It seems like whoever is complaining on Twitter and gets Google's attention might see-- JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. I don't know. We do have a lot of experience with automated image recognition. BARRY: But I'm asking, right now, is it automated, or is it not? JOHN MUELLER: I'd assume that there are definitely aspects which are automated.  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=510) |  Because I mean, we have a lot

of practice with images in general. So that's something that, from my point of view, there'd be nothing in the way of saying, well, we'll just apply the same knowledge to other types of images. BARRY: OK, if you are-- if your favicon defaults to-- automatically defaults to some generic favicon, and then you're like, wait, oh, this might have been bad, let me go ahead and change it, and you do change it, how do you tell Google about that? Or is that part automated?  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=540) |  JOHN MUELLER: I don't know what the

current process is there. BARRY: OK. And my next question about mobile-first indexing-- new sites will not get notifications starting July 1 if they're not mobile-friendly. JOHN MUELLER: Mobile-first indexing. BARRY: Mobile-first indexing-- they're not going to get that mobile-first indexing notification. But if they are mobile-friendly and you are doing mobile-first indexing because that's the default, are you going to send the notification saying, hey, there's issues here? JOHN MUELLER: As far as I know, not-- BARRY: OK.  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=570) |  JOHN MUELLER: --no. BARRY: But you don't

think-- based on your blog post, it said, generally, most sites that launch these days are not experiencing any issues. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. BARRY: OK, so I guess you may if you see that change. But for now, there's no notifications. OK, thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I don't know. That's an interesting question, if we should notify them. I think one of the next steps will probably be, for us, to figure out what kind of issues are remaining and to start notifying the old sites that  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=600) |  have these types of issues. And maybe

that's something where we could say, well, we might as well just flag all sites that have these issues, even if they're already switched over. BARRY: OK, awesome. JOHN MUELLER: All right, so let me take a look at some of the questions that were submitted. Is it possible that visitors from the Discover feed are attributed as direct none in Google Analytics?  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=630) |  I don't know for sure. So I

saw this on Twitter. And I asked, with the team, about it. And from what I understand, at the moment, it's not unified yet. It's not in the sense that all of the sources across the different Discover feeds that we have available, that they're all shown in the same way in Google Analytics. In general, I'd assume that, in the long run,  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=660) |  these kind of visitors that come from

this-- essentially another search surface have a normal search refer on them. It sounds like, at the moment, that's not the case everywhere yet. But that's generally the direction that things will be headed. The mobile-friendly test and the inspect URL tool in Search Console return a lot of other errors for a lot of websites when it comes to resource loading.  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=690) |  Mostly, it affects image files, JavaScript fonts,

et cetera. Since a number of resources not being loaded correctly is changing a lot each try, this is pretty weird. So why does this happen? And does it have any effect on ranking? Is there a way to correct these errors? So this is something which I think we need to make a little bit clearer in the tools at least in the sense that these tools are optimized more for speed--  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=720) |  so more for users who want a

fast answer rather than for completeness. So what generally happens there is, with these tools, we want to fetch all of the completely new versions of these embedded URLs-- so the JavaScript files, images, fonts, et cetera. And that means we sometimes run into time-out issues. And when we time out, then we show a generic error like this.  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=750) |  When it comes to indexing, we do

things a little bit differently-- or at least, for rendering within indexing-- in the sense that we can cache a lot of these files. We can use older versions of these files and just run the rendering like that. For example, font files are not going to change on a day by day basis. We might as well cache them for a longer period of time and just reuse them. So for general rendering in indexing, that's not something where you need to watch out for this type of thing.  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=780) |  I do think, in the testing tools,

we should make it a little bit clearer so that you know what's happening here, or maybe even that there's an option to say, like, I'm ready to wait as long as I get a complete answer. But at the moment at least, the case is still that sometimes you'll see these other errors in the testing tools. And you'll be like, what's happening here? You try it again, and then it works. If you see that it works, then, generally, that's  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=810) |  a find that everything's fine. Speaking about

crawl budget for JavaScript websites, is crawl budget related only to the first wave of indexing, the HTML fetch, or also the rendering wave? So in general, crawl budget is related to every URL that we fetch from the server. So if there are multiple embedded URLs on a page that are needed to render that page, and we have to fetch all of them, then those  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KrbFoPZ58R4/maxres1.jpg)



#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=840) |  are all included in the bigger group

of crawl budget. And that kind of makes sense. Because what we're trying to do is prevent overloading your server. And to do that, we try to limit the number of requests that we send to your server. That said, for most websites, crawl budget is not a topic that you really need to worry about. So there's no absolute number where I'd say, above this many pages, you need to worry about that. But if you're talking about a website that has less than--  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=870) |  I don't know-- a million pages, then,

for the most part, you don't need to worry about the crawl budget. That's something where we can still index pretty much everything from your site without running into any limitations. If you do have significantly more, especially if it's an e-commerce site, or you have lots of filters, or lots of facets within the sorting and searching pages on your website, then that's something where you might want to watch out for crawl budget and try to find ways to optimize the way that search engines can  

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=900) |  crawl your pages, and that they don't

run into too many unnecessary pages that also need to be crawled and indexed. Because a site had both microdata and JSON-LD structured data, the Google Merchant Center has been reporting errors. So we removed the microdata, but the error rate has not dropped. After consulting with Google and viewing the server logs, we found that it's a crawler who doesn't understand the website sometimes.  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=930) |  I really don't know what you're seeing

in Google Merchant Center. So for that, I'd really recommend checking in with the folks from the Google Merchant Center, which are probably the Google Ads folks. But I don't know what it is that you might be seeing there. I think the next question is essentially the same, also  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=960) |  with regards to Google Merchant Center. Again,

I don't really know what is being tested there. Language targeting, Google guidelines say this. If you have several alternate URLs targeted users with the same language in different locales, it's a good idea to provide a catch-all URL for geographically unspecified users of that language.  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=990) |  So I guess the question is, how

do you provide a catch-all, or should we just do an x-default? So essentially, with hreflang you have multiple levels that you can specify there. And from each level, if there is nothing that matches specifically that, then it kind of bubbles up to the next level. So if you have English for Canada, English for Australia,  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1020) |  and the user from English US comes,

then they'll generally bubble up and say, well, this is not Canada or Australia. But there's a generic English page, so we'll show the generic English page to that user. Similarly, if someone with a different language comes, and it doesn't match Canada or Australia or generic English, then if there is an x-default specified, then that'll kind of be used there. So that's kind of the setup that works here.  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1050) |  If you have one of the higher

level pages and you don't need to specify the lower level pages, and in general, as well, if you don't have anything that matches, it's not that we're not going to show your pages. We're going to give it our best guess and try to pick one that matches fairly well, or as well as we can figure out, what the user might be looking for. So essentially, when it comes to hreflang,  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1080) |  this is an opportunity for you to

specify an alternate version for a specific set of users. And if you don't want to do that, then you don't have to do that. And you can specify a more generic version, but you don't need to do that. And like I said, if we can't find a version that matches, then we'll still give it our best guess, similar to if you don't have hreflang at all, we have to deal with those websites, too. ANGIE: Do you mind if I jump in here?  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1110) |  JOHN MUELLER: Sure ANGIE: Hi. So I

have a kind of technical question about structured data. So I'm starting a product. It would be a product review website. And I'll give you an example. We'd have a type of article that's essentially a list of different reviews about related products. So let's say, 10 best camping tents. And you would have 10 different products that we would review in the list, written by a single author. So my first question is, is it against the guidelines  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1140) |  to have multiple review schemas on the

page? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I don't think that would work. Because we'd want to have the reviews for the primary content of that page. So if you have 10 unique things on the page that you're reviewing, then we wouldn't be able to map that review markup to one of those specific items. And similarly, we wouldn't be able to say,  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1170) |  use an aggregate review markup for that

page, because these are 10 completely different things. It wouldn't make sense to have an aggregate review for that. ANGIE: OK. So would it be better to choose one of the products on that page, and then have the review schema for just that one product? Like let's say we pick the best product and we put a review schema for just that product, is that within guidelines? JOHN MUELLER: That would work, yeah. Or if you split it out into 10 separate pages, that might also be an option.  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1200) |  It all depends on what you're trying

to do and how you'd like to have that look in the search results. ANGIE: OK, so if we paginated it into 10 different items, like as a different canonical for each item, and then had a separate review schema for each product, that would be acceptable? JOHN MUELLER: That would be fine, yeah. ANGIE: OK. And then also, is it better to have a product schema with review as a property, or to have a review schema with item reviewed,  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1230) |  and then the product, given that I'm

not selling the product on the site? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. I'd have to look at the guidelines for that. I'm not sure. ANGIE: OK. And then the last question-- so if I have an article schema and then the review schema, is there a way to connect them somehow? Or should I have just kind of two separate scripts on the page, one for the article schema,  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1260) |  one for the review schema? JOHN MUELLER:

You can put both on the same page. The difficulty, in general, with structured data, if you have different types on the page that we would show in different ways in the search results, is we'll pick one of those types and show it like that. So if you have two completely different things on a page, then it might be that we pick the one that you don't feel that strongly about.  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1290) |  So generally, I try to pick the

type that you really care about and primarily focus on that one, and not specify the other type. So for example, if you have a recipe on a page, and you also have a product review-- because I don't know, maybe you're cooking something with that product-- then we can't show both of those types in the same search result. So we'd have to pick one of those. And our algorithms might pick the one  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1320) |  that you don't feel as strongly about.

Maybe you say, well, this is really primarily a recipe page, then I would just mark up the recipe and not the product review. AUDIENCE: OK, does that mean that one could show up for one query and the other could show up for a different query, though? JOHN MUELLER: I don't think that would happen. I think we would choose a primary type for the page, and we would just show that one. ANGIE: OK, perfect, thank you. ROBB: John, I thought review scheme was only for product pages--  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1350) |  review schema, ratings schema. Because I've seen

a competitor put it on their category pages, and that's, supposedly, not-- it's against guidelines. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. Category pages would be the same thing, again, where you have multiple products that you're marking up. And that would, essentially, be the same being. We wouldn't know which of these products you're essentially reviewing. It's not the same thing, the same product that you're  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1380) |  reviewing multiple times. ROBB: Right. But they

do it, and they get the stars being pulled through into the search results for a category page. Because I thought, well, that's a good idea. And then I thought, mm, no, it's probably not. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I mean, sometimes that happens, that we don't catch it or algorithms don't pick it up. That can, unfortunately, sometimes happen. ROBB: Right. But it's not against the guidelines, or it is? Because I thought [INAUDIBLE] it is.  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1410) |  JOHN MUELLER: My understanding is that is

against. It's against, yeah. Because it should be reflecting the primary content of the page. And if you have multiple primary contents, than you can pick them all and say, well, they're all primary. All right, let's see. A question about manual action for unnatural links that affect some pages on the sites, no examples are provided, and I didn't do anything.  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1440) |  So how can I fix it? My

recommendation there would be to posts in the Webmaster Help forum, or check in with other peers who have done similar things or who have run across similar things. Oftentimes, there are some things that can be picked up on that you might be able to work with. If these are unnatural links that are affecting just some pages on the site, then it might also be that the [INAUDIBLE] team is just  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1470) |  neutralizing something for you that you don't

need to worry about. So I wouldn't panic directly. Instead, I would check in with other folks who can help you, to kind of look through the links to your site and think about, is there really something that you need to take action on or not. We bought a business that operated a number of domains, each representing a specific subcategory of the main topic.  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1500) |  I'd like to consolidate all of these

into the main site. Is there a limit to the number of domains that you can 301 redirect to your main site before setting off any alarms? There are 100 domains, and I'd like to 301 redirect them all to the relevant section on our main site. I don't really see a problem with that. I think that's something where, for the most part, if these are really moves that you're making, where you're  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1530) |  taking a specific product page that was

hosted on separate domain and putting that product page on your main site, then generally, that's fine. If you're just taking 100 random domains and redirecting them all to your home page, then I could imagine our systems looking at that and saying, well, this doesn't look like your moving content. You're basically just trying to take the page rank from these old domains and forward them to your new domain. And that might be something where our algorithms might say, well, we'll just ignore these for the most part.  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1560) |  But if you're really moving content from

one page to another page, if that's an external domain to your primary domain, that's perfectly fine. If we have a link in a dropdown menu, is it worth putting it one more time in the page content? What about the first link count? It's fine to put links multiple times on your pages.  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1590) |  There is nothing really specific that you

need to watch out for there. That's something where, if you have a reason to put that link multiple times on a page, then go for it. Sometimes, people don't find links that are within the menu somewhere. Sometimes it makes sense to highlight new and updated content in things like a sidebar. Or you have maybe something in the footer that you want to link to directly. All of those are completely reasonable reasons  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1620) |  to put a link multiple times on

a page. Should internal link anchors be diversified or 100% one anchor? Can a page be over-linked internally? You can do it however you want. So this is, essentially, a matter of your natural linking within your website. Sometimes if you have a shared menu, then you have all of that links with the same anchor text. There is nothing unnatural about that.  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1650) |  Obviously, understanding a little bit more of

the context of the individual pages helps us to understand how these pages can be shown in search a little bit better. So sometimes having a little bit of variety in the anchor text makes sense. But in general, that's something that you get automatically, in that, you'll have a link to a higher level category. And then from the category page, maybe you'll have like a list of specific subcategories. And from there, you have links to the individual products. And all of these links can be slightly  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KrbFoPZ58R4/maxres2.jpg)



#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1680) |  different across the website. And generally, that

happens naturally. Can a page be over-linked internally? I haven't really seen anything like that happen. The only thing that I do sometimes see happening is that, essentially, a page or a site ends up going into the direction of keyword stuffing, in that maybe they'll have a footer where they link to all pages on the website with a bunch  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1710) |  of different keyword-rich anchors. And then it's

less a matter of these pages being over-linked internally, but more that all of these pages essentially have all of this big collection of keywords on the bottom, where to us it looks a lot like keyword stuffing on the page itself. So that's one thing I generally avoid. But otherwise, if you're building a website and you're linking things naturally within your website, then I don't really see a lot of reason for worrying about that.  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1740) |  BARRY: John, can I ask a question

or do you want to keep going? JOHN MUELLER: Sure, go for it. BARRY: So the indexing issues, two questions-- one is, the ones from last week, they were both about Google having a problem indexing new or fresh content, correct? JOHN MUELLER: Oh, man, I don't know which ones were last week. BARRY: It was just last week.  

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1770) |  [LAUGHTER] Obviously, the one from April was

like a month ago. That was specifically de-indexing issues, removing index pages from the index by accident, so de-indexing content. The ones from last week seem to not being able to index new content. JOHN MUELLER: It's possible, yeah. I don't know. We have so many things happening that I am not 100% sure. But I think that that might be correct.  

#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1800) |  BARRY: OK. And I guess related to

that is, are you guys going to write up some post-mortem about the issue? If you remember, we discussed you might be doing that, so you can share something that's going on with webmasters, SEOs, and developers. Is that still something you're considering, or probably not? JOHN MUELLER: We're still considering it. It's something that sometimes is a bit tricky to put together, because so many different teams are involved. But it is something that, in general, we'd like to do.  

#### [0:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1830) |  I think a lot of these issues

are things that can happen to other websites, as well. So there's always some learnings that can be shared, which I think would be nice to do. BARRY: That's just about nice. It's also about knowing, is it removing content from your index, like older pages that were already indexed that might have data loss issues, versus brand new content that never was indexed that took maybe a couple hours longer to be indexed, or maybe 24 hours longer to be indexed?  

#### [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1860) |  And then there would be no data

loss in search console because that stuff was never in there. It's just different ways of understanding how Google bugs or potential bugs may have impacted my website might be useful. Not just a learning thing for SEOs, but more of a analysis thing, that people could look back and say, these dates may have less traffic because of x, y, and z. And maybe that's important for them to understand. JOHN MUELLER: I don't know how much  

#### [0:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1890) |  detail we would go into there. Because

a lot of these things, when things go wrong. they're usually based on our internal system. So it's not something where it's that trivial to say, this was exactly that, and therefore you don't have to worry about it anymore. So that's sometimes kind of tricky. BARRY: OK. And the only reason I bring it up is because I keep getting people saying, I don't think that issue from last Thursday  

#### [0:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1920) |  night was actually resolved on Sunday. I

still think there's issue. JOHN MUELLER: Oh, it was resolved before Sunday. BARRY: I know. JOHN MUELLER: It was just, at some point we were like, oh, maybe we should actually tell people it's OK now. BARRY: I understand that. But people are saying, no, it wasn't resolved because my site's still not fully indexed. Well, that's a different issue. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I mean, there are lots of reasons why sites are not indexed or why sites might not see their content being indexed as quickly as they'd like to see it. And a lot of times, those are just completely normal things,  

#### [0:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1950) |  which, I don't know, all of us

have seen over and over over the years. And they're not tied to any specific issue. So as far as I know, everything is running smoothly and has caught up. So if people are still seeing issues, then that would not be related to any of the old issues.  

#### [0:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=1980) |  Let's see. Let's say we wrap a

vehicle that advertises a relatively new website. Users that see the advertised website are likely to do what most users do-- type the URL into Google search. I don't know. People usually type the URL into a browser. But some people type it into Google search, I guess. Will their searches assist in getting Google's attention? In other words, will the site made better known to Google  

#### [0:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2010) |  by users searching for it. I don't

think that would really make sense. Because if they're explicitly looking for your URL, then we're already going to show URL for that search. It's not that we can learn anything better for that URL that people are searching for. So in general, I think it's a great idea to advertise a website in other ways other than just online, so it attracts people's attention.  

#### [0:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2040) |  And sometimes people remember these URLs or

the names, and they search for them and they go there directly. I think all of that is great. I just wouldn't assume that there's any kind of SEO benefit of people searching for a URL and then clicking on your website. On the subject of creating multiregional, multilingual sites, if we create pages for specific regions in their respective languages, should the URLs be written in that language?  

#### [0:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2070) |  You can do it either way. So

for us, URLs are primarily identifiers, in that we need to see a unique URL per language, so that way we can index those URLs in the individual languages. And if you want to use your URL that is written with words in that language, that's totally fine. I think that's a good idea, but it's not a requirement. There is no special bonus for having URLs  

#### [0:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2100) |  translated, as well. So that's essentially up

to you if you want to do that. We do have that, I think, as a recommendation in one of our guidelines, in the sense that it's generally good from a user experience point of view. But from an SEO point of view, it's not that you have any kind of special bonus for doing that. Search Console returning 404 for AMP URLs, but the pages are valid 200 and valid AMP.  

#### [0:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2130) |  Does Search Console still face issues with

AMP reporting? I'm not aware of anything specific there. So AMP pages are normal HTML pages. So if we see a 404 for a request of a normal HTML page, then I think that makes sense to show in Search Console. And that's also not something that would be related to the AMP content or not, because we wouldn't know that it's an AMP page before we  

#### [0:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2160) |  actually get the content there. So it's

not that we could do anything special for AMP pages and say, these are AMP pages with a 404, because we don't know that their AMP pages if we're seeing a 404. So my suggestion is, if you're seeing 404 errors for any kind of URLs that you care about on your website, then I'd double-check to make sure where that's coming from. In general, our systems wouldn't make up a status 404 for a page  

#### [0:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2190) |  and say, this is a page that

was not found, if there were any kind of internal problem trying to reach that page. You mentioned before that if you set up different subdomains targeting non-English languages, these can rank differently in the countries that they're targeting, and could have much less visibility than the English subdomain targeting the US.  

#### [0:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2220) |  Is it safe to assume that those

additional subdomains are being evaluated differently from a quality and relevance standpoint from the core subdomain, which targets English? Also, if you just translate the template and not the primary content, would Google see those translated pages as much less relevant than others with primary content written in the foreign language? So in general, the question about having localized content on a different subdomain or on the same domain  

#### [0:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2250) |  or with parameters or whatever, is essentially

mostly a matter of just the competition in those languages, in the sense that, sometimes you can have a page in one language, and its ranking really well, because it's a really well-known page in that language. And just because you have that page translated into another language doesn't necessarily mean that that translated page will also  

#### [0:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2280) |  rank really well for users of that

other language. So it's not a matter of how many signals are being passed with subdomains or main domains or subdirectories. It's really just a matter of, well, this is a page that's targeting Spanish users, and this is a page that's targeting German users, and they can rank completely differently, even though they're talking about the same thing. So that's something that, from our point of view, is kind of normal.  

#### [0:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2310) |  It's not that there's anything special with

regards to the quality there. Essentially, these are separate pages. The search results are different in those individual languages, especially in the individual countries. If it's a geotargeted page, if it's a page a thing that people tend to search for on a local basis, then those kind of environments are completely different. So the rankings there can be quite different.  

#### [0:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2340) |  And there's a question about jobs listings

with regard to spamming markup and some changes that were made there. I don't know specifically how the job listing pages are shown in search, with regards to how those are ranked individually. So I passed that question on to the team to see if I can get more information from them.  

#### [0:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2370) |  But I haven't heard back. Yesterday was

also a holiday, so sometimes it just takes a bit of time to figure out. I'll see if I can try to find an answer for you there. I'm analyzing a site that is mistakenly publishing two canonical tags on certain pages. When inspecting the URL in Search Console, it says there isn't a user-specified canonical tag-- so 0 instead of 2. Is that because Google is simply ignoring both  

#### [0:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2400) |  canonical tags since there is a conflict?

I don't know. It's hard to say without looking at specific examples. I suspect this would be easy to double-check with just making a test page and putting two canonical tags on there and seeing what happens. And sometimes, we do follow one of those, even though we don't show that explicitly. As always, with canonicalization,  

#### [0:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2430) |  it's a matter of multiple factors aligning.

So if, for example, we're confused with the canonical tag, but we see that all of the internal links are pointing to one version, or other factors are aligning with one version, then we'll just pick that one version. And that might be one of those URLs that you have specified as a rel canonical. So that's sometimes kind of tricky to follow back, because there are just a number of factors that are involved with canonicalization.  

#### [0:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2460) |  When combining multiple sites into one, do

you recommend using the Change of Address tool? Generally speaking, I'd avoid doing that, because the tool is really meant for forwarding signals from one domain to another domain, where you're really moving from one domain, everything from there, to a new domain, everything on there. I imagine you're not going to break anything by doing that in Search Console. But I also suspect you're probably not going  

#### [0:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2490) |  to see any advantage of using the

Change of Address tool if you're not really doing a change of address, but more merging multiple sites. In India, some People Also Ask answers appear from US websites, which are not relevant to Indian users. Isn't this supposed to be country-specific? I don't know.  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KrbFoPZ58R4/maxres3.jpg)



#### [0:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2520) |  Some of these features are country-specific, and

we try to do the appropriate localization there. Sometimes we just don't have enough information on a country's specific level. So we don't always show that on a country-specific way. So that might be the case with People Also Ask questions. I don't know. I haven't really looked into that specifically. Then there was a question about commas in large numbers  

#### [0:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2550) |  in a description. I'm happy to take

a look at those. My suspicion is that, from the Snippets team that is working on this, that they just do this by design to kind of unify all of the numbers that they find there. How can I track sessions for my UTM tagged local SEO business? It's not available on Analytics, although metrics  

#### [0:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2580) |  such as impressions are available. I don't

know how you would track that in Google Analytics. So that would probably be something you'd want to check with the Analytics forum or with one of the Google My Business forums out there, where you can see what other people are doing. If we have an established site and decide to add a blog to it, would it be a bad idea to put the blog on a subdomain?  

#### [0:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2610) |  Would a subdomain be considered a new

website? I don't think it would be a bad idea to put it on a subdomain. I think it's really a matter of what you're trying to achieve there. If you're trying to just expand an existing website, and maybe put it within your main website, if you're trying to add something in parallel to your website, then having it in a subdomain is perfectly fine. From our point of view, when talking with the indexing  

#### [0:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2640) |  teams, they consider subdomains to be just

fine as a way of adding content to a website. Talking with external SEOs, they're like, oh, subdomains are evil. You should always use subdirectories. So from my point of view, I think you'd be fine either way. And I'd look more into what makes more sense for you, what makes sense from a management, maintenance point of view,  

#### [0:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2670) |  from a tracking point of view, from

an analytics point of view. Sometimes it makes sense to have everything together in one unified location. Sometimes it makes it a little bit easier to separate things out a little bit. It's totally up to you. Does it affect my rankings? A few weeks before I have social bookmarked my site, and now it's marked me as spam, even after I have done that.  

#### [0:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2700) |  I don't really understand the question. It

sounds like you added your site to a social bookmarking service, and then the social bookmarking service marked your site as spam and removed it. I suspect we probably ignore that from an SEO point of view. But at the same time, if you're trying to build links to your website by using social bookmarking services, I suspect that's not going to be that fruitful,  

#### [0:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2730) |  in that probably it makes more sense

to focus more on your website first and make sure that it's really fantastic website, and then trying to make it so that people really appreciate your content and that they link to your site on their own, rather than you going to the social bookmarking sites. So essentially, I imagine most search engines have seen these social bookmarking sites and pretty much ignore all of them.  

#### [0:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2760) |  We implemented organizational structure data on our

site. We implemented local SEO. Is it advisable to also implement local business structure data, keeping in mind both the above search data have almost the same content, such as address, business name, et cetera? I don't know what you mean when you say you implemented local SEO. So that's kind of hard to say.  

#### [0:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2790) |  With regards to local business content and

organization, structure data, I think that's something that you can combine. So I don't see much of a problem there. I suspect, for the most part, we use these to just better understand where your business is located. So if you have a Google My Business listing already, then that kind of maps to your location, as well. And with regards to things like phone numbers, which we could show in search, we can pick that up  

#### [0:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2820) |  from structured data, as well. Additionally also,

the opening hours, of course, which we can also pick up from structured data there. The one thing I'd just keep in mind with all of these different ways of specifying this information is that it should all be in sync. So for example, if you update your opening hours on Google My Business and you don't update them on your website, then suddenly we're kind of in a conflict there, in that we see you updated it here  

#### [0:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2850) |  and your website says something different. And

which one do we choose? We might choose one. We might choose the other. We might switch in between. So that's something that makes it kind of tricky. So what I'd recommend, in a case like that, where you're not sure how you will update this data, is to focus on just one location to specify that data, so that you have one place where you need to update it. You can kind of keep that in mind. You can focus on that one location, update that location.  

#### [0:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2880) |  And then all the signals that we

have are updated automatically. Whereas if you have multiple locations where you're specifying the same thing-- which could be multiple types of structured data, it could be multiple kind of home pages that you have where you have this structured data specified, or the home page, Google My Business listing, maybe other external listings, as well, then you have to keep in mind that all of these should be in sync as much as possible.  

#### [0:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2910) |  So that affects the opening hours, things

like phone numbers, addresses. They don't change that often. But if you do have changes there, make sure that all these locations are updated so that we can keep your listing in one clean state, rather than being in the state of being uncertain which data source is the correct one today. I think that's pretty much it for all of the questions that  

#### [0:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2940) |  were submitted. Let me see. In the

chat, there's a little bit happening, but I don't think there are any specific questions. Oh, here-- does Googlebot still convert the hashbang into question mark, Escape, fragment? I don't think we do that at all anymore. So we really render the hashbang URLs directly, and we try to index those directly. So I don't think we use the pre-rendered version  

#### [0:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=2970) |  that you can specify with escape fragment.

It might be that others still use that. So maybe if you share something on Twitter or on Facebook, if they still use the hashbang setup, and that might still make sense. But in general, we deprecated that on our side quite a long time ago. So if you're still using that setup, I'd really recommend moving to something that's more URL-based, rather than hash-based. OLEG: Hey, John, that's actually my question.  

#### [0:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=3000) |  And that's the reason I brought it

up. We're actually trying to move to a more URL-friendly structure. So my question is, what would be the best way to setup this redirects, since you're saying they're not using the escape fragments. And this is-- can't really do service add redirects, how would you recommend doing it? JOHN MUELLER: You'd have to do that with JavaScript. OLEG: So window.location.replace-- is that the recommended methodology? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, yeah. OLEG: OK, I'll try that out. Thanks.  

#### [0:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=3030) |  AUDIENCE: John? JOHN MUELLER: Hi. NICK: I

have a question that I put in in the comments, but you didn't get to it. It's regarding a streaming content, basically long-running responses, if you will. So with the async frameworks that are available now Python and, I guess, Node.js and stuff, you can stream the content progressively to the page so that the [INAUDIBLE] content, for example,  

#### [0:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=3060) |  can be fed almost immediately. And then

the content that requires IO, like the database lookups, can come in at later points. My question is, how does Googlebot handle that? And what are the impacts on page speed metrics? JOHN MUELLER: I suspect we handle it badly. I'm not sure. I'd need to test that. But probably what happens is we try to render the page.  

#### [0:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=3090) |  And at some point, we take a

snapshot. So if you're still streaming the content at that point, then it might be that we miss the rest of the content that you're still streaming. So I suspect that would be kind of tricky. So what I generally recommend doing there is making sure that the initial content is available as quickly as possible. And then if you're streaming additional content, then that might be something where you'd say, well, this is not critical that it needs to be indexed.  

#### [0:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=3120) |  Therefore, I'll just continue doing this because

it works well for my users, and I don't need to have it indexed for search. Then that might be something where you say, well, that's a trade-off I'm willing to do. But I generally test with things like the mobile-friendly test, with the inspect URL tool, to see what comes up there. I suspect it might also start working better  

#### [0:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=3150) |  in those tools in the future, because

with indexing, we've switch to a modern Googlebot version. But for these tools, we're still using, I think, Chrome 41. So if you're doing something that doesn't work in Chrome 41, then it might be that, in these tools, you don't see it yet. NICK: OK. I was very happy to see that there is a switch from to the modern browsers. It makes, I think, a lot of people's lives a whole lot easier, so OK. I have another real quick question, unrelated.  

#### [0:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=3180) |  I have a site that uses a

top level domain that's niche-specific. It's dot run. And the content on the site is all US-based content-- well, US, Canada-based content. But it seems that most of my traffic right now is coming from anywhere but.  

#### [0:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=3210) |  Like Canada's not too bad, but I

get very little US content. I get a lot of UK, Australia, Sweden, a lot of European content-- users. And it lands on pages where the content isn't really specific, but [AUDIO OUT] doesn't, so to speak, if you understand what I mean. In other words, the users will come, they see that there's content there, but it's not relevant to them afterwards,  

#### [0:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=3240) |  and so they drop off. Is there

a way to influence that? Or somehow, is there something-- JOHN MUELLER: Not directly. So you wouldn't be able to say, don't show my pages in these countries. If you had multiple versions of that content, you could say, this is the version for UK users and this is the version for US users. But it sounds like you just have that US version at that level. So there's nothing really specific that you can do there.  

#### [0:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=3270) |  From a search point of view, I

don't see that as being problematic, essentially. If people come to your site and say, well, this isn't what I was looking for, that's perfectly fine. NICK: OK. The problem is, is that the people who should be looking for it aren't finding it, and the people who are looking for something similar, but not quite, are finding it, and then-- you know what I-- JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I don't know. It sounds more like-- maybe there's something that you can  

#### [0:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=3300) |  tweak with the content on those pages

to make it clearer which locations you're explicitly targeting. It's not that there's something technical, like a metatag that you can tweak and say, this is more for US and less for UK. NICK: OK, all right, thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. All right, it looks like we're kind of out of time. I see there's one more question in chat. Oleg, if you could copy that into the Hangout listing,  

#### [0:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrbFoPZ58R4&t=3330) |  then I can take a look at

that afterwards, as well. OLEG: Sure, will do. JOHN MUELLER: All right, great. Thanks everyone for joining. Thanks for all of the questions and comments along the way. I hope this was useful. And as always, the next Hangout I think is on Friday. So if you want to drop in there, that's perfect. I'll set more Hangouts up towards the end of the week, as well. So if that time doesn't work, then we'll find a different time for you. All right, thanks a lot, everyone. Goodbye.
