#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=0) |  [SIDE CONVERSATION] [LAUGHTER] JOHN MUELLER: All right.

Hi, everyone. And welcome to today's Webmaster Central Office Hours Hangout. My name is John Mueller. I'm a Webmaster Trends Analyst here at Google. And we have a bunch of guests here. Do you want to introduce yourself briefly? KEVIN: Hi, I'm Kevin from Zurich. Nice to meet you. MARCUS: My name's Marcus. I'm from [INAUDIBLE] also Switzerland. JASON: I'm Jason. I'm from France, as you can hear from the accent--  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=30) |  or not. [LAUGHTER] JOHN MUELLER: All right.

Do any of you want to introduce yourselves who are, like, in here? AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm from-- I'm British, but I live in Poland. I'm Paul, and I work for a large medical provider. We operate in about nine countries. So we deal a lot with medical [INAUDIBLE].. AUDIENCE: I'm Rob from the UK. And John broke my site a few years ago and won't fix it.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=60) |  [LAUGHS] KEVIN: And he's smiling. [LAUGHTER] JOHN

MUELLER: All right. I guess the others are kind of quiet. But you're welcome to speak up in between in any case. We have a bunch of questions that were submitted. But if any of you want to get started with a question, or any of you, feel free to jump on in.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=90) |  JASON: Can I ask a very general

question? JOHN MUELLER: OK. JASON: Yeah. I saw Gary who lives in Australia. And he was talking about images. And he was basically saying, I'm really interested in images and video and now I'm optimizing for images and video, the 10 blue links appear to be interesting him a lot less these days than they used to. Should we be looking at images and video much more? My vision, or what I've seen, is that Google results is becoming much more multimedia. The 10 blue links are disappearing slowly. I wrote an article on "Search Engine Journal" about the Darwinism and all of that.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=120) |  I'm completely obsessed by it. Images and

video appear to be something that will appear across the board, whatever the context. Is that where we should be bigger? JOHN MUELLER: I think images are underestimated. So that's kind of one thing. The other big thing is-- I mean, a lot of people search visually. A lot of the newer social platforms are really focused on videos, like Instagram is something which is basically just images.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=150) |  So there's a lot of interest from

people in finding visual content. I think the main thing that-- at the moment, when it comes to focusing on images I recommend not just focusing on images as a technical thing-- like, I have a hundred images, I need to optimize them and get them into Image Search-- but rather thinking about the user journey of how someone might search visually for things that you have on your website,  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=180) |  and how you can be in the

right place at the right time. So instead of just taking a hundred images from your website and adding some alt tags that have keywords that match those images, think about where would you present this, or how would someone search visually for your content, and how can you present your content at the right time. JASON: Yeah. You mentioned alt tags. How much does Google take into account the context around it, the actual text around it? JOHN MUELLER: We take that into account. JASON: An enormous amount? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's something where, when  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=210) |  we show an image in Image Search,

and we think it's important for creating an image search, it's something where we want the whole landing page to kind of match. So we prefer not to have this random image in the corner somewhere, but really a landing page where the user knows that if they go click on that image they'd find that image on the page, and they'd find more information about what they were searching for. So if you're searching for, I don't know, a type of luggage, then you might search visually.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=240) |  You might say, well, this is the

type I want, you might refine it kind of visually. And then you go to that page, and you want that piece of luggage there. You don't want it like somewhere in the sidebar as a small thumb. JASON: Yeah. Stuart Rogers was talking about shopping, and you took a picture of something, I want that. Bing are apparently very good at it-- sorry to say Bing, but-- are you as good? Are you better? Are you-- are you doing-- JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. I don't know how we would compare. But I think it's one of those things where  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=270) |  it's easy from a technical SEO mindset

to just say, I have so many images, I will optimize these images. And it's a lot harder to think about it in terms of how people might go to your site. JASON: And the context of the page. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, yeah. I think it's also worth considering that sometimes your content might not be something that people would search for visually. Like, I don't know-- if you have machine parts, maybe people wouldn't search for it visually. JASON: Unless they love to look at machine parts.  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=300) |  JOHN MUELLER: Well, or unless they're like

DIYers, people who are doing it themselves, and they know it's like, I want this thing, I don't know what it's called, but it looks like this. JASON: Mind you, taking a piece of your washing machine and you can't put back together again. Taking a picture and saying I need that piece-- that's quite a reasonable search to make. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. JASON: Jolly good. Next time I fail to put my washing machine together, I'll do that. [LAUGHTER] JOHN MUELLER: High expectations. AUDIENCE: John?  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=330) |  JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. AUDIENCE: John, I would

actually just back you up on this, because we use Images very heavily in medical. And they work very awesome for us. So if you present great images and for Google Image Search, then you will start getting the traffic. I think people don't look at the images enough on their website. JOHN MUELLER: OK. Yeah. MARCUS: That's good. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. JASON: Sorry, but another thing. You were talking about it-- well, I was talking about it.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=360) |  You confirmed the context of the text

around the images. Just thinking about it, another client who, they were keyword stuffing the alt tag and saying, well, actually, alt tag needs to describe the image. They're saying, but then I don't get my keywords. And so in fact, if you think about it, the number of images in your article, for example a blog article, if you just read the alt text, you should be able to describe what the page is about if you're using your images correctly or well. And if you've got an H1 or a heading with a text and an image-- a heading with a text with an image, each one of them  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=390) |  is in a specific context within the

page, and they all come together. And from what I can see, ideally you would have these alt tags that actually describe what the page is about. Is that reasonable? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I think it depends on what you're trying to do. Because what the alt attribute-- you're supposed to describe the image. And sometimes, the description of the image isn't really what your page is about. Like, you might have a picture of, I don't know, beach, but your page is about vacation homes and [INAUDIBLE].. So-- JASON: Well, the example in fact-- sorry--  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=420) |  it was that they sell surveillance stuff

for homes for old people. And they were saying, old couple on a sofa, not surveillance. And then they got a security guard, and then they've got a camera. But you say, if you say old people at home on the sofa, security guard, and camera, you've described the page. So the fact that you don't have to put old people sitting on a sofa, you putting the alt tag as security camera, security, security, security, security, surveillance, whatever it is.  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=450) |  And I think from my point of

view, alt tags, that is a nice way to look at it. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. Yeah. JASON: Thank you. I'm very glad you agree with me. [LAUGHTER] So I'll shut up. Go ahead. KEVIN: Well, I'm doing the-- doing the same-- so describe the image but put some one to three keywords at the end of the alt text, more like this. So put the keywords, last keyword, inside. But the most important thing is the description about the image, more like this, not do keyword stuffing  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=480) |  like this. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. You probably

don't even need to put them in the alt attribute there. If those keywords are on your page, then-- KEVIN: Yeah, normally is. JOHN MUELLER: --that's enough for us to pick that up. JASON: Oh, I've got another question. Sorry. JOHN MUELLER: OK. Go for it. JASON: I don't [INAUDIBLE] just-- it's about that, the word not being in the page. I think that's really, really interesting, because I had a client who did flower delivery, and we were ranking number one for cheap flower delivery, and the word "cheap" was not in the page. And I'm wondering, is it because we were cheap  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=510) |  and Google realized we were cheap or

because it was somewhere else on the site? Because it wasn't in the page at all. MARCUS: Oh, backlinks. JASON: Oh, backlinks. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [LAUGHTER] JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I'd kind of point towards links or just general context that might come into play. Maybe, I don't know, reviews, depending on how that's set up, if you're linked from maybe Yelp pages and people  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=540) |  write about you like that-- like, it

was really inexpensive or whatever-- then that might be something that we could pick up. JASON: Yeah. From having good-- from my point of view, I was just going, Google deduced it was cheap. I mean, we were cheap, and we just didn't bother saying, because we're idiots. JOHN MUELLER: I mean, we-- I don't think-- yeah-- [LAUGHTER] I think putting it on the page would kind of make sense if you're-- if that's actually an important part of your business model. But I don't think we would look at the prices and say, oh, this is below average. We will-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] JOHN MUELLER: --cheap.  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=570) |  JASON: I was overestimating it. JOHN MUELLER:

It doesn't do that. JASON: Yeah, OK. Yeah. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. MARCUS: I have a question about-- it's like an old topic but in a new perspective talking about multiple H1. And there was this rule, like one H1 per document and stuff. But now in HTML5, in the specifications, they have these sections, like the head, the article, the aside. And in the specifications, each of them, contains one H1.  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=600) |  And so how do I-- is Google

already, like, following HTML5 specifications? Or will I confuse the Googlebot? JOHN MUELLER: I think this is something that-- it comes up a lot, that people are like, can I use multiple H1 headings? And I think even before HTML5, it's  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=630) |  like you said, like whatever. Use whatever

you want. We have to deal with whatever is on the page. So it's not that we would run HTML Validator and say, oh, it's invalid with these two H1s, we will demote your website. We have to make do with what's on the web. So with HTML5, it's even normal, I guess, with multiple H1 headings. And we try to make do with that. It's not really a problem.  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=660) |  MARCUS: OK, that's good. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah.

I mean, we use the headings to try to understand which blocks of text belong together and to give more context to the blocks of text on a page. So if you use H1 headings for that, or H2 headings, or H3 headings, all of that kind of works. It's not that we require you to have kind of this strict theoretical structure on those pages. JASON: Then the HTML-- MARCUS: Good to know. JASON: Sorry. HTML5 blocks then come into play, and they're important, I think, with the menu, the amount  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=690) |  at the side of the article. Or

not really? JOHN MUELLER: Not really. JASON: Oh. Damn, that was my favorite, too. [LAUGHTER] JOHN MUELLER: I mean-- MARCUS: Mine, too. [LAUGHTER] JOHN MUELLER: I mean, for semantic understanding of the page, it makes sense. But for us, we basically make do with how the websites are built. And a lot of people, they don't have this understanding of what semantically belongs together. So we recognize this, I don't know, big HTML element here is a menu, or is a sidebar,  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LmrpXweVbNQ/hq1.jpg)



#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=720) |  is something that's shared across the site.

And whether or not it's called that with the right HTML tags is kind of irrelevant for us. We can recognize it's something that's shared across the site, so we can treat it appropriately. JASON: You're saying shared across the site, and that means, if you're consistent, it doesn't matter how rubbish your rules are. If your rules are consistently applied throughout your site, you're going to win. You're going to be-- JOHN MUELLER: Well, I don't know-- I don't know about winning, but it definitely helps. Yeah. I think the important part for--  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=750) |  JASON: Forget about HTML5. Just be consistent.

Brilliant. JOHN MUELLER: I think the important part is really that we can tell which parts of your page are primary content and which parts are kind of boilerplate, we call it-- so the things that are more secondary-- so that we can really tell when someone is searching, and something is within the primary content of your page, then we can really highlight your page, rather than, if we can tell it's in the footer or somewhere on the sidebar, then maybe we don't need to rank your page a high for it,  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=780) |  because you don't see it as that

important. All right. Wow. Lots of people have jumped in. Pretty cool. So let me grab a few questions that were submitted. And then we can move more towards organic discussion again as well. Let's see.  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=810) |  Can I stay updated on Blogger, because

it has a date within the URL? Suppose I'm updating a page with fresh content and notifying via Search Console. You can definitely use Blogger. And you can definitely have a date in your URL. That's fine. If you update that content, then usually we can pick up the date within the content of the page as well and just pull it out like that. So that shouldn't be a problem. You might consider using something like, I think, the Pages feature in Blogger,  

#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=840) |  where you don't have the date within

the URL. I'm not sure if that's still on Blogger or I'm mixing something up. But that might be an option as well. How can I block negative keywords traffic from my website? I don't want my website to appear for some problems. Is there a way to solve that? No, not really. I think if you don't want your website to rank for certain keywords, then obviously maybe just not  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=870) |  put those keywords on those pages. But

otherwise, there is no trick to kind of block keywords from ranking for your pages. And most people usually have the other problem anyway, that they want to rank for things, not that they don't want to rank for things. In the categories of an e-commerce site where there are different products listed, is it possible to include the aggregate rating? Or is that only for products of the same brand?  

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=900) |  So the aggregate rating structured data should

be only for the same type of product. So it shouldn't be across different products. So if you have a category listing page, you shouldn't use aggregate rating for that. Aggregate rating is really if you have one product and there are multiple reviews of that product, then you can create an aggregate rating of that. Oh, my gosh. Someone is asking about subdomains or subdirectories.  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=930) |  It's been discussed how subdomains are sometimes

treated as part of the main domain, sometimes not. My question is whether the same consideration may in some cases also apply to brand name domains with different top-level domains. We have different-- we have our site in nine different languages in the same Search Console account with the main domain. The only difference is top-level domain.  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=960) |  Question goes on a little bit, but

essentially these are different domains. So that's not really something that we would tie together and say it's one site. What you might see in some of these cases is that we pull these different domains together in the site links. When you search for your brand name, for example, we might pull in from the other languages or other countries. That kind of makes sense. But it's not the same as a subdomain or a subdirectory.  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=990) |  OK. I don't know. Are there any

questions from you all in between? AUDIENCE: Yeah. I have a quick question regarding de-indexing. We'd recently acquired a domain bloom.com, and it had been redirecting to bloomcircle.com. The issue that we're running into is that Google's indexed 4,000 bloomcircle.com URLs as bloom.com URLs, and we're a little apprehensive to get started on our work, because the content we're looking to put on the site is family related  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1020) |  as opposed to beauty and wellness related.

So what we've done is we've removed pages from Webmaster Tools as well as 410'ing the pages. From what I understand, it could take months for all the URLs to de-index. But I was wondering if there's any way to expedite that timeline and any recommendations you'd have. JOHN MUELLER: OK. So you're redirecting? Or are you just having a new domain? AUDIENCE: We have a domain, and that domain previously was redirecting to another domain.  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1050) |  JOHN MUELLER: OK. Yeah. So I-- in

cases like that where it's really content that you don't want to have indexed anymore, I would just use the URL Removal Tools. And the URL Removal Tools are limited, I think, for 90 or 180 days. But you can just renew that after that. And that gives you a little bit more time to kind of fix things within your website. So to 410 those pages so that they drop out completely.  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1080) |  The URL Removal Tool basically just hides

them in the search results. So if your primary interest is really to make sure that if someone searches for your domain they just find the content that you want them to find, then that would work. AUDIENCE: OK. The timeline for all those URLs to get de-indexed, would it still be like a multiple months timeline? Or would it be shorter than that using the URL Removal Tool? JOHN MUELLER: So the URL Removal Tool is basically instant.  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1110) |  It's something on the order of like

a half a day. So that makes it really quick. And the reprocessing of the old URLs is something that depends on the URL. It can take multiple months to be reprocessed and drop out completely. But with the Removal Tool, you have those 90 days, and then you can renew that a couple of times. So basically, you can kind of hide them until they're actually reprocessed. AUDIENCE: OK. Thank you.  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1140) |  AUDIENCE: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. AUDIENCE:

All right. We have a slight problem in India. So we have around 15 IVF clinics in India. And they've actually started ranking for pornographic terms. So this is quite new. And I'm wondering if there's anything we can do to stop this. We've only noticed it in the last month  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1170) |  that this has started to happen. JOHN

MUELLER: OK. I don't know. It's hard to say where that might be coming from. My guess initially is that maybe there are weird links to those sites that-- AUDIENCE: Yeah, that was my thought of maybe from our Indian colleagues have done something previously that might have made this occur.  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1200) |  But the other site's probably about three

years old, and we've only just seen it in the last month, this kind of trend appearing, so. JOHN MUELLER: So, I mean, there are a few things kind of come together. On the one hand, if it's due to links, you can use the Disavow Tool to kind of get those links dropped out. And the other thing is that I suspect that the actual users of your site  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1230) |  wouldn't be using those terms anyway. So

it's something-- AUDIENCE: Yeah, of course. Of course. JOHN MUELLER: Theoretically-- AUDIENCE: But you kind of don't want a medical brand kind of associated with pornography terms, so. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. Yeah, I think it's something that might be more of a theoretical problem than an actual problem. But of course, when you search for it and you see it, or someone else searches for it and points it out, then that's still awkward.  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1260) |  But I would mostly focus on the

links side to see if there are any issues there, and then use the Disavowal Tool to kind of have those dropped. It might also be worth double checking that there's nothing on your site that's hacked, where maybe someone is dropping things in there as well. Because that's a really-- AUDIENCE: Yeah. Yeah, we've had a look at the HTML and stuff like that to see if someone's dropping in some of these keywords in there. But, you know, obviously with IVF and fertility,  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1290) |  then there's kind of some associated terms

across those other searches that we don't want to be associated with. So yeah. It's kind of-- just any ideas. But we'll go and have a look at the backlinks, which is one of the things that we thought might be the case as well. JOHN MUELLER: OK. Now-- yeah, that's always kind of awkward. AUDIENCE: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have similar questions to last questions  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1320) |  asked by Belliata. Like, I have a

website from India. And the website is e-commerce. And earlier we were ranking for like generic terms, but now we are linking for generic terms plus adult keywords. So like, we are ranking for adult keywords in last one month, like adult keywords plus or generic keywords.  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1350) |  So it is happening from last one

month. And the website is e-commerce. There was no site problem, but now we are ranking for some adult words. So is there any way to block such kind of traffic? Because we have checked all website completely from link-wise. We already did all links in different tools and different-- checked all complete Webmaster. And also, we have checked all HTML part of the website,  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1380) |  like each and everything, like if some

adult keywords are present on all content. But our website is completely free from adult content, because we are dealing in jewelry, ornaments. So there is no any adult keyword on our website, but still we are ranking for some pornographic terms or adult terms. So this is the issue we are facing from last one month.  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1410) |  JOHN MUELLER: OK. It's kind of-- AUDIENCE:

It sounds like an India problem, John. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I guess it is. These weird coincidences-- AUDIENCE: Two people on one call. I don't know the person there either. So it's got nothing to do with me. So-- AUDIENCE: That's why I asked a similar question in like Google Webmaster questions query also. Because my clients are like-- they are not happy, because they are thinking we are not ranking on search terms, but why we are getting lots of clicks from some adult keyword?  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1440) |  And actually, there-- if we are ranking

for adult keywords with all generic terms, then they are giving us 100% bounce rate as well. So they are affecting our website's overall credibility, because implementing-- like average bounce rate was improving for our website. So it is like negative for us. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. So I guess, first of all, I wouldn't worry about the bounce rate with regards to SEO.  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LmrpXweVbNQ/hq2.jpg)



#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1470) |  That's not something that we would use.

But maybe if you two could copy some of the URLs from your site and some of the queries that you're seeing into the chat here, then I can pull that out and share that with the team afterwards. AUDIENCE: Sure, sure. We'll send you-- or, like we can show you those search terms we are ranking for, and we can also send our website URL as well. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. Maybe just drop them here in the chat, and then I can pull them out after the Hangout.  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1500) |  AUDIENCE: Sure, sure. Sure. AUDIENCE: OK. JOHN

MUELLER: All right. AUDIENCE: Thanks. AUDIENCE: Hey, John. AUDIENCE: Sorry, go ahead. AUDIENCE: Hi. Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I have a question. So previously I had a subdomain. OK. Let's say, for exams, xyz.com. So I have created a subdomain like, exams, xyz.com. So we have just built a link, and we have just  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1530) |  created a site. We have just built

everything. And second, we have-- we just created backlinks also. Then what we did is like, that's OK, and set up some [INAUDIBLE] subdomain is not that much good, then we just move to this are subfolders. So then what we did is, we just created subfolders with the yearly, like, let's say, 2018 Exams, 2019 Exams, like that. JOHN MUELLER: Just to interrupt very briefly, would it be possible to get closer to the microphone? It's really hard to understand you. AUDIENCE: Yeah, can you hear me now? JOHN MUELLER: Better, yeah.  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1560) |  AUDIENCE: Yeah. Can I start from the

beginning or-- yeah, sure. So previously I had our own subdomain. Now I just have a subfolder. So previously I thought that a subfolder is good, better than the subdomain, so we just moved to the subfolder. What we did is, in the subfolder we just created the pages in the year basis, like 2018, 2019, like that. But after we moved from subdomain to subfolder, none of the pages were ranking. Then what we did [INAUDIBLE] is again, we just created pages in a normal way. Like, let's say, for exams, just Exams we created.  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1590) |  Previously we had like Exams-2018, Exams-2019. Then

we decided to just create Exams. So let's say for www.xyz.com/exams, like that we have created. Now the problem is, none of the pages are ranking properly. Previously the rankings happened for the exams or the xyz.com. Even that is also not ranking actually right now. So what can be done from our side to improve the rankings actually? JOHN MUELLER: OK. So first of all, moving from a subdomain  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1620) |  to subdirectories, that should be perfectly fine.

Like, you can move within your website, because as long as you watch out for redirects, that seems like a normal thing to do. What it seems more to me is that these are just general ranking changes that are happening, either on Google's side or just across the web in general. And that's probably what you're seeing there. So less something that is due just to your technical site  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1650) |  structure, like subdirectory and subdomains, but more

just, we're ranking your site differently. And that can happen for subdomains. It can happen for subdirectories as well. AUDIENCE: So we just redirected all the subdomains to subdirectories right now. But still, the backlinks weren't rebuilt for subdomains. Of course, it's also getting redirected. But still, I feel that none of the pages are ranking. Let's say 90% of pages are not in the first page in the SERP results, actually.  

#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1680) |  So even we just tried for the

past couple of months and still we just face the negative impact of that. So even if you make any changes in the web page, it's just going backwards. It's not coming front end in the SERP results. So do we have to build more backlinks for subdirectories compared to subdomains? Or is there any other activity that we can do from our side? JOHN MUELLER: No, you definitely don't need to build more backlinks for subdomains or subdirectories. So those-- that's a completely normal way to build a website.  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1710) |  So it's not something where you need

to do anything special with regards to the links. Just generally, the way that you're approaching it, like we should have more backlinks for subdirectories than for subdomains, makes me kind of worried that maybe you're building links in a kind of a weird way that our algorithms are picking up on. So that's one thing I'd be kind of cautious about. But in general, to me it sounds like this is just normal ranking changes, as they can always happen.  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1740) |  If you redirect from one URL to

a different URL, a subdomain or subdirectory, we forward all of the signals that we have. So it's not that something would get lost or be less valuable if you have one set up like this or set up like that. AUDIENCE: OK. And when it comes to the web pages, of course when we moved from subdomain to subdirectories, so we have to change the interlinks also, right? So in case if you have an old interlinks of subdomain, we have to change it to the interlinks, correct? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. AUDIENCE: It should not be the older one, correct?  

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1770) |  JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, yeah, definitely. So if

you change your URL structure, you should change it consistently across everything that you have-- with your sitemap files, your internal linking, if you have a rel canonical on these pages, all of that should match your old structure. AUDIENCE: Got it. Thanks, John. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. AUDIENCE: Hi, John. How are you doing? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] AUDIENCE: Look, I just wanted to ask you a quick question. So we actually operate a educational publishing website.  

#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1800) |  And we've recently implemented a lead-in metering,

so to pass the text content of our documents-- they're actually behind a paywall. So we've implemented that. And we've seen a weird thing happen, where it's our-- the content that we have that covers pharmaceutical, like pharmaceutical terms or chemistry terms, are actually being flagged as having content hacked injection in the Search Console. And so I've gone through all of them, and they're basically--  

#### [0:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1830) |  I'm certain that it's nothing to do

with any content being injected. But what it seems to be is that Google is picking up certain terms in there and thinking that this is the pharma hack. So I'm not really sure what to do about this. I pressed the Request Review button, but is there a way that we can sort of flag that this is legitimate content without the-- like, without removing these particular [AUDIO OUT]  

#### [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1860) |  JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. So the Request Review

button is definitely the right approach there. And sometimes we do pick up weird things as being hacked where they're actually not hacked. So I could imagine pharmaceuticals is one of those things that tends to show up on a lot of hacked sites. So maybe we're kind of associating things there. Usually with the Request Review, that's something that would get processed, and someone that would look at that-- if you want,  

#### [0:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1890) |  you can also drop some of the

URLs here in the chat and I can double check. AUDIENCE: Awesome. OK, I'll drop a couple of links. Thank you. Thanks, guys. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. All the link dropping in the chat. The one place where you could drop links. It doesn't give you any page rank boost but it's useful for me. And maybe it helps your site. Who knows? [LAUGHTER] JOHN MUELLER: Nandhini, I think you had a question.  

#### [0:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1920) |  AUDIENCE: OK. Hi. We run a ecom

business. So we are just planning to launch the website in different languages. So the question is whether we have to throw-- the URL has to change if you are providing in different languages, or should just the content has to change? JOHN MUELLER: Good question. So for content in different languages,  

#### [0:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1950) |  we need to have it on separate

URLs. So that's something where, if you automatically change the language of the content and you keep the same URL, we will just index one version, and we won't be able to tell that you have multiple language versions of that content. It's something that used to be pretty popular in that sites would try to do something fancy and automatically show the right version of the content. But in practice, it means that when  

#### [0:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=1980) |  Googlebot crawls from the US, we only

see the English content. And if you have content that's translated, it's like, we never see it, we can't show it in the search results. So if you do have international content in multiple languages, make sure that there are multiple URLs associated with it. And you can use subdirectories. You can use parameters. You can use subdomains. However you want to split it up, it should just be multiple languages-- like, one language per URL.  

#### [0:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2010) |  AUDIENCE: OK. And one more question also.

It's about the duplicate contents. So we have two different pages-- like the product listing page which has all the brands listed, and a separate brand listing page. So the brand listing page, we have placed a rel canonical to the product listing page. But it's usually considered-- the brand pages are considered as duplicate content. Is there any way that I can remove the duplicate content? I want it to be indexed and show in the search results.  

#### [0:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2040) |  So is there any way that I

can do it? JOHN MUELLER: You can block the whole page from being indexed, but it's not something where you can block a part of the page from being indexed. And usually for this type of duplicate content, we can understand that this block of text within the page is duplicated across multiple pages, and that's fine. It's not a sign of low-quality websites. That's-- it's completely normal. What happens in practice is, if someone searches for something  

#### [0:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2070) |  in that duplicated block of text, we'll

know multiple pages on your site have that block of text, and we'll try to pick one of those pages and just show that. So it's not that we would demote your website for having this kind of duplicate content. It's just we would try to filter it out and show just one of them in the search results. AUDIENCE: OK. Thank you. JASON: So I can ask a question. JOHN MUELLER: Sure, sure. JASON: It's about-- it's similar-- related to the language question.  

#### [0:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2100) |  Can you point out the dangers of

redirecting according to IP, i.e., if somebody's in France, you'd redirect them systematically to the French version, if they're from the US, you'd redirect them to the English version. Can you set out the dangers of doing that from an SEO point of view? JOHN MUELLER: Well, we would see probably a redirect to the English version if you have one. And we would drop all of the other versions then. So it's kind of-- JASON: That's drastic. JOHN MUELLER: Well, I mean, like, you spent a lot of time making the different language  

#### [0:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2130) |  versions. And if in the end they

don't get indexed, it's kind of a shame. JASON: And second question, then, is having everything in a subdirectory, for example domainname.com/fr, domainname.com/en, and never having that root indexed, is that a problem? JOHN MUELLER: That's OK. JASON: That's OK? Because I've had a problem with Search Console getting the site validated, which implies to me that Google isn't fully comfortable with it. JOHN MUELLER: That might just be the verification, where if we're looking for that meta tag  

#### [0:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2160) |  and we can't get it on the

root of the page and went like, whoa. JASON: This is redirect-- JOHN MUELLER: We can't tell. JASON: The second question is, I've had a couple of clients in France who do this. And systematically, they don't get the rich site links on brand searches. And as soon as we stick them on the root domain for the English version or the French version with the other ones in subdirectories, the rich site links come back. Is that me imagining things, or is that a true problem? JOHN MUELLER: That shouldn't be the case. That shouldn't-- it should do-- JASON: It's happened twice. So it's not an obviously big case-- [INTERPOSING VOICES]  

#### [0:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2190) |  JOHN MUELLER: OK, yeah. Yeah, if you

could drop the links in the chat, then I'll-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] [LAUGHTER] JASON: Yeah. I'll go and write it on the screen, rather. KEVIN: Or write it on a paper. JASON: Oh, that's a very traditional idea. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. JASON: Sorry. JOHN MUELLER: No, no. The rich search results, that shouldn't be tied to the structure of the site. JASON: Well, I kind of figured it was because Google was getting a little bit confused. I mean, it was combination of the redirects plus the subdirectories with no root. I mean, I think not having a root, a default version,  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LmrpXweVbNQ/hq3.jpg)



#### [0:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2220) |  is a bit weird. JOHN MUELLER: It's

certainly a bit weird. But some sites do it. It kind of works. JASON: OK. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. So if you're using hreflang, then you would specify the root as being the [INAUDIBLE] default version, because that's one of those-- kind of the redirect. But even without hreflang, that should just kind of work. JASON: OK. Back to the drawing board. Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. Cool. Oh, my gosh. So much text in the chat.  

#### [0:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2250) |  I'll copy this out and take a

look afterwards. Let me see if there's anything-- there's still lots of things that were submitted. Let me try to go through some of these fairly quickly. I have an enterprise client whose crawl recently dropped off. Thankfully, traffic and rankings have not been impacted, but we're working to restore Google crawl. We focused on improving page quality, reducing errors, improving page speed.  

#### [0:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2280) |  Nothing has seemed to work so far.

Any advice on where to focus and how to remedy Googlebot crawl issues? So I think that's a pretty complicated topic. It's kind of hard to say what exactly I would focus on there. I think there are a few things you might want to start out with. And that might be first of all making sure that you have access to a log file so that you know what is actually being crawled, and ideally, also the log files from earlier,  

#### [0:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2310) |  so that you can compare what Googlebot

was crawling before to what Googlebot is crawling now. And it might be the case that Googlebot is crawling a lot less, but it's still crawling the important URLs of your website. So maybe that's perfectly fine. Then from crawl rate point of view, we basically have two aspects that come into play on our side-- on one hand, how much we want to crawl from your website, and on the other hand, how much we feel  

#### [0:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2340) |  we can crawl from your website. So

in particular, if we think that your server is kind of slow, if it responds with errors when we crawl, then we don't want to cause more problems so we'll throttle our crawling. And similarly, if we can see that your server is fast, responding quickly, no errors, server errors showing up, then we'll try to speed things up as much as we can until we reach the limit of things that we feel like we want to crawl.  

#### [0:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2370) |  So those are-- kind of multiple aspects

are kind of competing with each other a little bit there. But again, first I'd double check to make sure that it's really a problem, because it's easy to spend a lot of time on these issues and it's not really a problem. And then maybe double check the speed information from your server. For crawl, it's not so much the speed that you would see in a browser, so not PageSpeed Insights, but more the speed information in Search Console, the time  

#### [0:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2400) |  that it takes to download a page.

That's what we would use for crawling. And yeah, I think those are pretty much the aspects I would focus on there. Let's see. I had a domain that wasn't indexed on Bing due to it being in some kind of spam backlink-- blacklist. After manual review, they lifted the ban, and it started indexing. And then basically, if the domain  

#### [0:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2430) |  was flagged on Bing, what's the chance

it was flagged on Google? I don't know why you were flagged on Bing, so it's hard to say if that would affect Google. Usually-- I mean, definitely we have different indexing systems. We have different web spam systems. So all of that should be pretty separate. So usually, what happens on our side is, if there is a manual pattern from the Web Spam team, you'll see that in Search Console. So if there is something that's blocking your site, you'll see that, you can respond to that,  

#### [0:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2460) |  you can do the reconsideration request, and

then everything is essentially back to normal. So that's mostly what I would focus on there. Oh, my gosh so many questions left. But we're kind of running low on time. Maybe I can just take questions from either you here or you here. JASON: You didn't get a turn. [INTERPOSING VOICES] JOHN MUELLER: Go for it. KEVIN: Does Google make different between newspaper  

#### [0:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2490) |  sites and blogs on the Discovery? JOHN

MUELLER: The Discovery-- so the kind of-- the automatic feed? KEVIN: Yes. JOHN MUELLER: I don't think so. So it's not limited to news sites. It can be blog sites. I've seen forum entries there as well. So no. KEVIN: OK. JOHN MUELLER: I think it's an interesting topic, because it's one of those things where, depending on the site you can get a lot of traffic from that. But it's really hard to optimize for it, because--  

#### [0:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2520) |  KEVIN: It's crazy. JOHN MUELLER: --there's no

keyword. You don't know what people would be interested in next week. So you'd kind of have to understand the niche yourself and kind of think ahead. JASON: I was talking to a musician who was asking how-- this is Google Maps and Discover-- asking how he could build up his audience. Thinking about it in the middle of the night, I was thinking, here, you've got this YouTube channel, and you get people to watch the YouTube channel. Would that then mean that he would pop up in Discover  

#### [0:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2550) |  if he had a gig in that

town? Or is that pushing things too far? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. I don't think that would be directly related. But I don't know if YouTube videos are shown in Discover. Maybe they are. JASON: No, but-- I'm sorry. The idea is to get them tagged as being interested in this particular musician so that when he's playing a gig in their town, that he would come up on either Google Maps for you down on the bottom line or on Discover, because Google knows that they're interested in that particular artist. JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. JASON: Darn.  

#### [0:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2580) |  JOHN MUELLER: I mean, a lot of

these things-- I could imagine, theoretically, there is some machine learning pipeline that's trying to connect all of these things. But it's-- JASON: At 3 o'clock in the morning, that seemed to me incredibly reasonable. So James Kirby, if you're listening, we don't know. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I don't know. I think it's one of those things where theoretically we could combine a lot of things. But with-- I find with a lot of the machine learning approaches is it gets creepy really quickly. So it's always important--  

#### [0:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2610) |  I mean, I don't work on these

things. I don't know how these things are handled. But I find it really useful to be able to follow back, like, how did you come up with this suggestion? So as the user, you can look at that and you say, well, this was due to, like, me having looked for this musician's name a couple of times, looking for concerts a couple times where I didn't find anything, and now there's something here, then that kind of makes sense. JASON: It's more likely to be a link between the search  

#### [0:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2640) |  behavior and Discover than there is between

YouTube and Discover? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. I don't know if you could say that. JASON: Well, I-- JOHN MUELLER: I imagine, also, it's something where the activity on YouTube wouldn't be something that we'd be able to take into account with the search. Maybe for policy reasons, maybe it's just because different silos within Google. But it's quite separate, I would guess. JASON: I mean, I'm really intrigued by Discover. I mean, from-- you must be, too. I mean, the stuff that comes up in Discover  

#### [0:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2670) |  for me is not necessarily things I've

been searching for. So I'm wondering where it's getting the information. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. JASON: It gives me Liverpool football scores, but I never set that. I got and look at them on Guardian. Or-- you know, I'm-- JOHN MUELLER: I think, though, it kind of matches. It's not totally off topic. JASON: Oh, yeah, it's not search behavior. It's surfing behavior which is doing that. That's on Android phone, I think about it. JOHN MUELLER: I don't really know. JASON: Sorry. I'll shut up. MARCUS: It depends. JASON: It depends. I'm just really curious about it. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I know some people use it quite a lot,  

#### [0:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2700) |  and other people don't use it at

all. Some people adjust the settings quite a bit to say more of this, more of that. Curious to see how that-- AUDIENCE: Hey, John. Hey, John, I have a question. JOHN MUELLER: OK. AUDIENCE: Will Google read the URL after the query parameter? JOHN MUELLER: Yes, yes. So the URL parameter is-- all of that, we do use that. It's something that doesn't block crawling or indexing.  

#### [0:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2730) |  So if you need to use URL

parameters, that's perfectly fine. If there are parts of the URL parameter that you want to have dropped, then I would use the URL Parameter Handling Tool in Search Console, or at least make sure that you have the rel canonical set to kind of drop those parts of the parameter. MARCUS: Will that tool still work-- AUDIENCE: No, the query-- even after the query parameter, will it read the-- will it read it? JOHN MUELLER: Yes. AUDIENCE: OK. JOHN MUELLER: What do you mean, after the query parameters?  

#### [0:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2760) |  AUDIENCE: Like, I have a domain. And

after that, I use the query parameter so that if-- like, I can have a different content over there. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. So if it's with a question mark and then some key value things, that's perfectly fine. If it's with a number sign, like the hash symbol, then that's something that we would drop. AUDIENCE: OK. JASON: You just said [INTERPOSING VOICES] AUDIENCE: Yeah, sorry? JASON: OK. AUDIENCE: Will-- by adding events tracking,  

#### [0:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2790) |  will it affect my site? Like, in

case of a page size? JOHN MUELLER: What are you adding again? I missed it, sorry. AUDIENCE: By adding the events tracking code to the website, so will it increase my page size? JOHN MUELLER: If you're adding more code to the pages, then that increases the page size. Usually it doesn't affect the time for a browser  

#### [0:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2820) |  that much if you just add some

structured data, because it's something-- it's not like a giant block of text. It's kind of reasonable in size and it compresses well. So it does affect the size, but usually not so much the speed. And with regards to your tool, I suspect we'll move it over. So I mean, that question comes up, I don't know, every day. It's like, this tool is only in the old one, like,  

#### [0:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2850) |  does that mean you're abandoning it? And

it doesn't mean that we're dropping it. So we try to drop all of the things that we know we don't want to move over and the things that we have left at the moment, we're trying to find ways to move that to a new system so that we can continue to use it. MARCUS: Do you really consider the settings I do in the tool? Or is it just for me that-- JOHN MUELLER: No, we really use that. We really use that. We use that so much that sometimes the Indexing team  

#### [0:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2880) |  will contact us and tell us to

contact websites and say, like, hey, you're doing it wrong. You're blocking things. That occasionally happens. So it's really easy to use that tool and say, oh, Google should ignore this parameter, and then you don't realize that, actually, a big part of your website relies on that parameter, and you set it wrong. So that's kind of why we have such big warnings there as well. So you should really know what you're doing  

#### [0:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmrpXweVbNQ&t=2910) |  before you click around here. OK. Let's

take a break here. I'll copy all of the chat out and double check the things that were left. And-- let me just do that really quick before it all disappears. Thank you. Thank you all for joining in. Thanks for all of your questions, comments, answers.

JASON: Thank you for having us. [INTERPOSING VOICES] JOHN MUELLER: And I'll set up the next batch of Hangouts, but I might set some up for next week just to try things out, to try different setups out, because apparently the Hangouts on Air is going away on the 1st of August, which is not that far away. So we need to figure something out. All right. Thank you, everyone, and have a great weekend. Bye. MARCUS: Bye. AUDIENCE: Thanks.
