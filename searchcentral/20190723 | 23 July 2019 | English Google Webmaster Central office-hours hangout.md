#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=0) |  JOHN MUELLER: All right, welcome, everyone, to

today's Webmaster Central Office Hours Hangout. My name is John Mueller. I am a webmaster trends analyst here at Google in Zurich in Switzerland. And part of what we do are the Office Hours Hangouts, where folks can join in and ask any kind of webmaster or web search related questions they might have. The YouTube Live Hangout is going away August 1st.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=30) |  So we'll be switching to a slightly

different model. I think we'll try to do it with the Hangouts Meet set up, which is kind of tied into Google Calendar. And I'll try one of those on Friday to see how it works. On the positive side, there will be more room for people to join in live. On the downside, we can't livestream though. So I'll record those and put them on YouTube afterwards.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=60) |  But I think the general set up

with you all submitting questions and me trying to find answers for you that will remain. As always, if any of you want to get started with the first questions, feel free to jump on in. If not, that's fine too. BARRY: We could talk about updates if you want. JOHN MUELLER: Updates, I don't have any update news.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=90) |  I saw lots of blogging and tweeting

on updates. So I don't know what specifically is happening there. I don't know. We'll see. I haven't chatted with Danny about that, so not quite sure. BARRY: OK. JOHN MUELLER: But we always do updates. So-- BARRY: Yeah. JOHN MUELLER: I think it's more a matter of is this one of those core updates?  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=120) |  And it's like which month will it

be called after? BARRY: They named this one. They call it-- [INAUDIBLE] from webmaster wants to call it the Maverick update-- JOHN MUELLER: The maverick update. BARRY: --for the new movie, I think. JOHN MUELLER: But that's not even out yet. That's kind of like calling an update something that hasn't even happened yet. BARRY: That's pretty crazy. JOHN MUELLER: It's like calling it the Christmas update now. I don't know. That wouldn't make sense. BARRY: I didn't name this one. You can't blame me. JOHN MUELLER: I can always blame you, don't worry. BARRY: You can just blame Gary.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=150) |  It's better that way. JOHN MUELLER: OK,

we can blame Gary. All right, otherwise, I'll just get started with what was submitted. And we'll see where we can go from here. Can I set a page URL as slash best leather jackets when the title and H1 of my page is ten best leather jackets? Will that keep you warm in the winter?  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=180) |  Will it harm rankings of that page

if those exact queries are in the URL. I want to set it like this. Because I might update the product count and add more details to the page in the future. And I don't want to change the URL every time I update the page. Will Google consider this to be unnatural keyword stuffing? Users won't mind. So I think Google shouldn't demote that page based on those exact queries, right? That's a great question. From our point of view, you can call that page or use a URL, or whatever you want.  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=210) |  Some people use text, like you're suggesting

there. Some people use numbers. It's essentially up to you. The keywords of the URL are something that we do look at slightly. But it's a very, very, very tiny factor. So it's not something I would really worry about too much. I think your general goal of keeping the URL the same is great. That's generally something I would aim to do.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=240) |  Every time you change a URL and

you have to set up redirects, you kind of run into a situation where you have the redirect setup. You have to keep maintaining those redirects for essentially forever. You have to track the links going to the old URL and the new URL and update the links going to the old URL. It's always a bit of a hassle. So time you can look a little bit into the future and think about what you want to have on a page in the future and making sure that URL still works from my point of view  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=270) |  is fantastic. That's especially the case when

you're looking at the overall URL structure of a site. So this is just one blog post or article. If you set up your website in general to kind of have a structure that works for you in the long run, then that makes it a lot easier to keep those URLs. So if, for example, you just have an e-commerce website now and you plan on perhaps setting up a blog, or setting up--  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=300) |  I don't know-- product reviews or something

like that in the future, then maybe it makes sense to have that e-commerce section in a subdirectory from the start or somewhere slightly separated. So that you can add multiple sections of the site over time as you kind of grow. So instead of having the situation where you set up the e-commerce site in the root of the home page and a year later you have to set up redirects from all of those URLs to something slightly different,  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=330) |  you're already from the start in a

place where you can expand your site in the directions that you think might make sense over time without having to revamp everything else on the website. So from that point of view, any time you can look ahead and pick a URL that works for you in the long run, that usually makes things a little bit easier. That also goes for domain names. So if, for example, your website. you're thinking of, well, I want to write about leather jackets.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=360) |  Because I think leather jackets are really

cool and maybe you have some expertise on the topic. But at the same time you think, well, maybe in the future I want to write about jogging shoes or something else, then it probably makes sense to pick a domain name that's a little bit generic enough, that's maybe something that you can brand in various ways. So once you do kind of get to the point where you say, well, I have written everything about leather jackets that I can possibly write about.  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=390) |  Now is the time to start expanding

into shoes. Then you don't have to think about, well, do I need to get a new domain name? How do I set up redirects from the old one to the new one? What do I have to watch out for? What kind of technical issues might I run across when I try to do that? So any time you can think ahead and pick URLs that stay for a longer time, I think that's effort that's well spent. You mentioned that Google's algorithms  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=420) |  have become critical in the health medical

niche over the past year. And it's pretty clear that's the case after seeing the volatility across many sites in that space. If a site doesn't entirely focus on health medical and only has some older content related to health medical topics, is it best if they just remove that content from the site? For example, maybe they just aren't qualified to write about certain health topics. But they did so in the past. Would Google's algorithms be less  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=450) |  critical of that site over time if

that your money or your life content was removed? I think that's kind of tricky. It's one of those topics that we've talked about a little bit with the ranking and indexing teams over time. And it kind of bubbles down to you know that some of the content on your site is not fantastic. And you're kind of wondering, well,  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=480) |  what should you do about that? Usually

the two options, or maybe three options, that you can think about there are on the one hand, improving that content. That's something that the ranking team is always kind of encouraging us to tell you about. So from their point of view, if you know that your content is low quality in some regards, then find a way to improve that content. Because you obviously put that content out there for a reason. And if you want to keep that content out there, then  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=510) |  find ways to improve that content so

that you don't have to kind of think about this situation, will Google recognize that my content is bad? Because if your content isn't bad, then there's nothing bad to recognize there, right? The other alternative is essentially just to remove that content. That's what Glen is suggesting here that you put this content out there. And over time, you realize that maybe it's not something  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=540) |  that you want to stand for. And

you decide to just remove that content. That's obviously, an option as well. Again, talking with the ranking team, usually they tell us well, people shouldn't just remove the content if they can improve it. So I don't know. Take that with a grain of salt, if you will. I think sometimes a website just grows over time that it's unreasonable or unfeasible to kind of go  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=570) |  through and improve all of the low

quality content that you know about. So that might be something where you say, I really just don't want to focus on this niche anymore. I'll remove that content and move forward with the rest of my site in the direction that I've chosen to go. So that's another alternative. And a third alternative is kind of something in between, where you say, well, actually, I want to have that content on my website. I just don't want to have it findable in Google.  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=600) |  And for that you would just put

a no index on those pages. I think that's a reasonable alternative if you have a really good reason for that content to be on your website and you need it there for users when they're interacting with your website. For example, if you feel that-- I don't know-- your category pages are really not something that should stand on their own. Because they just have snippets of information. They're not really that exciting. Then maybe you put no index on those. So that users can still go there if they click around  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=630) |  on your website. But they're not indexed

by default. And therefore, Google won't take those into account when evaluating your website overall. So those are essentially the three options that you have there. And from my point of view, I think you can pick whichever of those options makes the most sense for you. From our ranking team's point of view, obviously, they like to have high quality content. So they'd like to encourage you to improve the quality of your content if you can.  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=660) |  I think from practical reasons, sometimes that

just isn't that easy to do. So pick whichever one works best for you. From our point of view, any of those options if you do that, when we reprocess your website over time we'll see that this low quality content is actually gone. And we can focus on better quality content and evaluate your website based on that. TOM: John, I've got a quick question related to that, if it's all right to ask.  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=690) |  JOHN MUELLER: All right, go for it.

TOM: I actually know a company loosely that works in CBD oil. And they're looking to obviously build out their content strategy. But they actually know another brand that got hit [INAUDIBLE].. They're quite nervous around it. I mean, they're wanting to write about it. But I mean, they're not medical [INAUDIBLE] themselves. And whoever wrote it wouldn't be qualified in that regard. I mean, do you think it's a bit of a risk them going into it? Or do you reckon it's a necessity? I mean, which way do you see it almost?  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=720) |  Because obviously, I know they are quite

apprehensive about getting hit by anything and then losing their sales pages. JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. I don't know how they would see themselves in this regard. It's something where I mean, we don't use things like the quality rater guidelines as a one-to-one ranking factor when we say exactly like this and I'm going to link it exactly like that. But rather that's something that our quality writers do or look  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=750) |  at when we give them essentially search

results to compare, to see which of these search results is better, which direction should our algorithm evolve over time? So I would certainly take the quality rater guidelines and use those as a guide for situations like that. But obviously, there is no absolute answer there. And it's something where if you're already saying, they know a lot about this, but they're not experts, then that's already kind of a shaky foundation,  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=780) |  right? So that's something where maybe it

makes sense for them to work together with some experts and to put together some real expert content, where it's clear to anyone who's reading those pages that actually this information is correct. And it's trustworthy. It's something that an expert has written or an expert has reviewed. And accordingly, it's essentially something that anyone can take and forward to their friends and say,  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=810) |  this is something to watch out for

or something important that you should read on this topic. TOM: [INAUDIBLE] JOHN MUELLER: I think it's always tricky with these kinds of situations. Because it's not like a technical thing where you either do it right or you do it wrong. So it's hard for me to give an answer that is yes, you should go like this, or no, you should do it like that. TOM: Thank you.  

#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=840) |  JOHN MUELLER: All right, long question. We've

created our website in 2013. Our SI was above 10 in March. I'm not sure what SI is here. We then switched to a different domain name to connect our Austrian page together with our German and our Swiss pages together after climbing until six SI. I'm not sure what SI is.  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=870) |  We were kicked back down to two

within a few weeks. So a few questions. Why does a transfer of trust from the old to the new domain take so long? I really don't know what you're looking at with regards to transfer of trust. So in general, when you do a site migration, so when you move from one domain name to another, that's mostly a technical change.  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1KwTPIz13XA/hq1.jpg)



#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=900) |  And the important part for us is

really that we can map, or ideally map, everything one-to-one from the old domain name to the new one. So that we can forward essentially all the signals from the old domain to the new domain. So in particular, if you have a site structure on the old domain, make sure you have the same site structure on the new domain. So it's not just a matter of URLs from the old domain  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=930) |  somehow redirecting to the new domain, but

really mapping one-to-one from the old domain to the new domain. So when you have it set up like that and you use something like the change of address tool in search console, which checks a few of those factors too, then usually the site migration there should go fairly smoothly and fairly quickly. I've seen some cases where people are saying, well, within two to three days everything was back to kind of the same situation afterwards.  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=960) |  So that's kind of from a technical

point of view is site migration, some of the things you should watch out for. We have a ton of detailed information in our Help Center on specific items to also watch out for. So I'd double check that to make sure you have all of that covered. Then there is another aspect that you have mentioned here that you now have a German domain and a Swiss domain. I'm not sure if you had that before, or if that's something that you also changed with this move.  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=990) |  Assuming you added these with the site

migration, then you're back in that situation where you don't have a one-to-one mapping anymore. And any time you take one domain and you split it up into multiple domains-- so in this case, maybe you had one global domain and you split it up into the Austrian, German, and the Swiss domains-- then that's something that does take quite a bit of time to be processed. Because we have to essentially reprocess all of these domains individually and understand how URLs on each of these domains  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1020) |  should be evaluated and how they should

be shown in search. So that sometimes takes a bit of time. That's another thing to watch out for. A third thing to watch out for-- I think you're hitting all of the complicated topics-- is if you have Austrian, German, and Swiss content. If this content is essentially the same content just  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1050) |  on different domains, then what will likely

happen is we will pick one of those URLs for each kind of set of URLs that we have there and choose that as a canonical. So with the hreflang, assuming you use the hreflang markup for these pages, we will still swap out the URLs depending on the location. But we'll pick one of them as a canonical URL. And that's the one where we'll pull the information from for indexing. So from a practical point of view,  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1080) |  what that means is in the search

results we'll try to show the appropriate local versions. However, in Search Console where we show information by the canonical URL, both for the indexing information as well as the search performance information, we will show it by canonical URL. So it'll look a bit skewed there. Assuming you have that situation that pages across the German Austrian and Swiss version are essentially the same content,  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1110) |  just for different countries. Then, again, in

Search Console, you would have a really tough time kind of understanding which of these country versions is ranking which way, which makes it a little bit trickier. And then, finally, from the domain name, it sounds like you do have kind of a business model that's focused on some, sounds like financial industry content  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1140) |  here, where I have seen a lot

of reports in the past couple of months where sites we're seeing fluctuations based on kind of the way that our ranking algorithms have re-evaluated kind of the relevance of these individual sites. So that could be flowing in there as well. So you have a bunch of things which are kind of happening at the same time. And assuming you moved your domain in March, and you split it up into these three country versions,  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1170) |  and your domain is kind of in

that financial industry, then you have a few things that could be making your life a little bit trickier. Where you might want to, from a first point of view, make sure that everything technically is OK with the site migration, especially if you're splitting things up across multiple country versions. And double check that all of that is OK. Then double check, of course, that the metrics that you're  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1200) |  tracking are actually useful metrics for your

website. So, in particular, if we are picking a canonical across these different versions for some of those pages, how are you tracking that? How are you tracking the traffic from Search? Is that something that you're tracking overall? Or are you looking at it per country, where maybe it's hard to compare kind of a previous situation to the current situation? And then thirdly, kind of make sure that past all of these technical details,  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1230) |  that you're really focusing on all the

right elements on your website itself. That you're providing content in a way that is useful and relevant for users. And that you're covering essentially some of the things that we've been talking about with some of the newer updates. So I think you kind of go into the updates themselves as well. Last year, there was a Google update for Your Money Or Your Life. Is there is that the reason for the new finance pages  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1260) |  to rank behind the old pages? Again,

these kind of general-- we call them core algorithm updates. They don't focus on things, or we say, you're doing things wrong and you need to fix them. But rather, we essentially try to re-evaluate how we determine the relevance of the website overall. And that's not something that is based on kind of the age of the domain. So if you moved from one domain name to another,  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1290) |  that doesn't mean that your website will

never have a chance to compete with the old websites. If you've done that domain move properly, then you're essentially in the same state as you were before. So that's something where it might be that either you did something from a technical point of view, slightly complicated or incorrectly. Or it might be that just about at the same time, there were these algorithm changes that also affected your site in that way.  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1320) |  Should I prevent the old domain from

being indexed with robots.txt? No. That-- definitely not. If you have an old domain, and you set up redirects in the new domain, then-- BARRY: [INAUDIBLE] JOHN MUELLER: Whoops. Somewhere. If you set up a redirect from the old domain to a new domain, then you should not block that by robot.txt. We should continue to see those redirects.  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1350) |  Looking for site:old domain in Google cache,

why does the old domain appear in the search results? And the title and description match the new domain? That's something that is our algorithm is trying to be helpful. And it's confusing in this particular case. So our algorithms are seeing that you're searching for the old domain name. And they know the old domain name is associated with that site that we know about. So we'll try to show it to you.  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1380) |  If you look at the cache page,

you'll see that this is actually the new domain name, though. So that's a little bit confusing as a webmaster and kind of meant to help users who were searching for the old domain and don't know that it has actually moved on. For the query posters in Sweden, I can see that two of the domains have been given a carousel and mobile. Does this work for category pages for products?  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1410) |  Should we send item list with the

products for category pages to increase our chances to get a carousel? Or are there other ways of using structured data that can help us to be given into the carousel? So, the carousels that we show in Search are essentially algorithmic. And it's something where once we've kind of been able to pick up the content from the structure data on a page,  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1440) |  we'll be able to show that. But

that doesn't mean that we will always show that. So, perhaps you're seeing these carousels for these sites for that query at the moment. Maybe for other queries, we're showing a carousel from your site. So that's something where you can't really force that type of rich result just by using structured data. I would recommend double checking the developers guide  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1470) |  for the structure data types that you're

interested in to make sure that the setup that you're looking at is really compliant with our policies, so that in the long run, it'll be something that works for your site and not something that you have to suddenly fix if it's not complying with our policies. Our website is scoring low on page feed insights for pages with embedded YouTube videos. Without the videos, the score is 100.  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1500) |  Which has better SEO benefit? Pages with

embedded YouTube videos or a top score that's really fast on pages without the videos? That's hard to say. So, I think first of all, I just need to make sure that it's clear that the page feed insights tool and in general are kind of speed tracking for pages is not something that would exclude other Google  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1530) |  products and services. So, if you're using

some product from Google or some service from Google to add content to your pages, and that's slowing your pages down, we will show that in the scores. It's not something where we'll say, well, they're using YouTube. And YouTube is fine. So therefore, we will just kind of ignore that in our scoring. If we see that you're embedding something, regardless if it's from Google or not, that's slowing your pages down, that should be reflected in the score.  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1560) |  And that would be the way that

we would take that into account when it comes to ranking things for kind of the mobile speed ranking change. So that kind of said, this particular situation with the YouTube videos is one that I hear every now and then. There are different techniques that you can use to embed YouTube videos on a page. Some of them are a lot faster than others.  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1590) |  So that's something where I would double

check to see how you embed these videos on your page, if there are ways to embed them that don't necessarily slow things down for your users. And to kind of think about what it is that you're trying to achieve with those YouTube videos. If it's really the situation where you're saying, oh, we don't care if these YouTube videos are on here on these pages or not. We just want to rank well. Then, maybe that's a sign that those YouTube videos  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1620) |  aren't really critical to your content. So,

maybe that's also a hint in the direction of well, maybe you should focus more on the textual content than on the videos. On other hand, if you're saying, well, these YouTube videos are critical for our pages. They're critical for our users to get a full picture of the product or the services or whatever we're talking about on these pages, then I would recommend either way that you can embed those videos in a way that works well  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1650) |  for users that doesn't cause a lot

of latency when the pages are loaded. And there are lots of kind of tricks around-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] JOHN MUELLER: --finding ways to make those a little bit faster by default. Then, we have a giant question on the topic of coupons. The content users are looking for is simple and terse.  

#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1680) |  There are only a few ways to

rephrase, say, $5 with this code. On the surface, all results look alike. The difference in quality seems to be the number of coupons and whether these actually work, which is difficult for Google to observe. It seems that excluding results by detecting duplicate content doesn't work well at all. The results are very similar. This can be exploited on a very large scale by companies placing the same content trivially transformed  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1710) |  on multiple domains. One tactic I saw

predominantly in non-English content, not English countries, was to add a big blob of text below the actual coupons. This could be to make the overall page look more unique to Google. Finally, the question, is adding a long piece of text below the actual short content, even if users ignore it, something that currently could help a site to rank better?  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1740) |  So, I think, first of all, I

totally appreciate all of your research into these kind of coupon sites, these white label sites that you found and flagged. It is something that we're looking at internally as well to figure out how we can best handle these. So that's definitely useful. With regards to the kind of the general question of, should I  

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1770) |  add a lot of--a big blob of

text to the bottom of my content to make it a little bit more unique? That's something that we don't only see in non-English languages. That happens across the board. It's really common, for example, on e-commerce sites, on category pages, where, if a site is, say, too lazy or not that invested in creating category pages that are actually really good, then we'll often  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1KwTPIz13XA/hq2.jpg)



#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1800) |  see all of the products for that

category on top. And then on the bottom, in really small font, two Wikipedia articles that essentially focus on those keywords in that category page. And from our point of view, that's something that generally doesn't work that well, because it confuses us fairly easily. Because on the one hand, you're bringing all of this e-commerce content.  

#### [0:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1830) |  So, in the case of an e-commerce

site with categories, you're bringing the e-commerce categories on top with all of the e-commerce content. And then you're adding this essentially Wikipedia article full of informational content on the bottom. And the goals of those pieces of content is very different. And that makes it kind of tricky for us to understand what this page is actually about. Is it something that we should show for people who are interested in buying something? Or is this a page that we should show to people who are interested in researching a topic?  

#### [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1860) |  What is kind of the goal of

this page? So that, from my point of view, is something that probably doesn't do that much good for a site. In general, for e-commerce sites in particular, my recommendation there would be to make sure that you have actually useful category content. So that it's cleared both to users and to search engines  

#### [0:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1890) |  what this page is about. I can

understand the situation that you can't create content for every category page that you have. But at the same time, if you're just copy and pasting content like this, or writing this big blob of text that's not meant for users to read, then that doesn't really do your site that much good either. So my general recommendation would be to more drop those kind of unnecessary blobs of text  

#### [0:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1920) |  on the bottom. I would, however, still

make sure that you do have enough useful content on the page. So if all of the content on the page is kind of these two, three words snippets, like links to products within a category page, or links to coupons on a coupon page like this, then there's not really that much useful information to kind of rank this page for. So instead of going for the situation where there's not  

#### [0:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1950) |  a lot of useful content to a

situation where we're confused because of all of the content on this page, I would aim for a situation where it's actually pretty clear what this content is about and what the value of the content is. So to write kind of reasonable category content rather than just a blob of text. The other problem with adding a giant blob of text is that frequently, it goes into the direction of keyword stuffing. So even in situations where we're not completely confused  

#### [0:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=1980) |  as to the intent of the page,

we quickly run into a situation that, oh, this keyword is mentioned 2, 3, 400 times on this page. Maybe we should be careful on how we rank this page for that keyword. So, keyword stuffing is one of those things which you probably want to avoid. So, that's something that I tend to see more on these pages where you're adding just kind of textual content for the sake of having textual content.  

#### [0:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2010) |  Where maybe you heard some guy somewhere

saying, well, you need to have at least 500 words on a page. And our category page doesn't have a lot of text. Therefore, we'll put 500 words of text on this page. If you go down that route, then quickly, you're in the area of, we should write SEO text for these pages, which means artificial including our keywords so many extra times. And then, even if search engines don't get confused about the intent of the page,  

#### [0:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2040) |  they'll be in the situation where, we

don't know if we should really trust this page for these keywords. Because it's obvious that they're doing keyword stuff. So, I realize that doesn't help answer your question in a way that I say, like, yes or no, you should do this. Personally, I would tend to avoid going down this path and instead creating reasonable content instead of just a giant blob of text.  

#### [0:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2070) |  OK. TOM: Hi John. JOHN MUELLER: Hey

TOM: Yeah, John. I have the same related question this content, since we're talking about this content part. So my question here is, so let's say, actually, I [INAUDIBLE] at Google. So we are just focusing on user experience, OK? So let's say I have a [INAUDIBLE] website like for [INAUDIBLE]. OK, in the [INAUDIBLE],, we aren't able to add much content. Of course, we can enable that. But since it's adjusted [INAUDIBLE],, I can just put what is [INAUDIBLE] today in some country and with two, three line of text.  

#### [0:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2100) |  So is that a possible to rank

in Google? JOHN MUELLER: Sure. I mean, it's possible to rank in Google for any kind of content. I think if you're going out there with the intent of, I want to write a minimal amount of content and rank number one for kind of competitive queries, then that's probably not  

#### [0:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2130) |  going to work out so well. But,

writing a lot of good content and writing really useful content for users, I think that's something that, over time, will work out for most websites. TOM: So the thing is, like, we can't able to [INAUDIBLE] with less number of content, right? So that will be the conclusion in this URL? JOHN MUELLER: Can you repeat that? TOM: So you mean to say that the conclusion is, if you are just having the minimum number of credentials,  

#### [0:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2160) |  you can't able to placing a [INAUDIBLE]

piece. JOHN MUELLER: Oh. Like, there is no word limit for content to be shown in Search. So it's not that you have to have minimum so many words on a page in order to be ranked. It's even so that if a page is blocked by robot.txt, it can still rank, despite us not having any content from that page at all. So, it's not that there's any minimum word  

#### [0:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2190) |  length that you need to aim for

in order to be competitive. Obviously, depending on the topic, depending on what you want to talk about for that topic, you might need to write more. You might need to write less. But that really depends on the topic and really depends on the users, how you're fulfilling that user need. And sometimes, less content is more useful. Sometimes more detailed content is useful. Sometimes a mix across a website is useful,  

#### [0:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2220) |  where you have kind of introductory content

and then more detailed content, which is longer. So it's not that we have any specific word count that you should aim for. TOM: Yeah, so that is also based upon user experience. JOHN MUELLER: I think user experience is a good way to look at it, looking at maybe user studies that you do with your particular users. Assuming you're the expert in this field, you'll know a little bit more about which topics need more explaining and which  

#### [0:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2250) |  topics need less explaining. So that's kind

of where I would say, like, you should kind of know where you need to have more content or you need to have less. TOM: Yeah. BARRY: Could I butt in a little bit? JOHN MUELLER: Sure. BARRY: So John, if you were a search algorithm, how would you-- you know, what specific metrics would you use to figure out a good user experience on a website? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know.  

#### [0:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2280) |  I'd probably have to think about that

a bit to see what would work well for me. I mean, it's something where, if you have an overview of the whole web, or kind of a large part of the web, and you see which type of content is reasonable for individual topics, then that's something where you could potentially infer from that, like, for this particular topic, we need to cover the sub topics.  

#### [0:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2310) |  We need to have this much information

or more images of fewer images on a page. That's something that perhaps you could look at like that. I'm sure our algorithms are quite a bit more complicated than that, though. BARRY: OK. And anything new and exciting coming from the Google Search Console team that you want to [INAUDIBLE] that? JOHN MUELLER: New and exciting coming from the Search Console team. They're working on a lot of stuff recently.  

#### [0:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2340) |  So I think we'll see some more

stuff happening. I know they need to migrate a lot of the old stuff to new search console. So that's definitely one thing that's also happening over time. But, they're pretty busy. So, I don't have anything in particular at the moment to preannounce though. BARRY: OK. All right, thank you. AKILAN: Yeah John. I has a-- John? Can you hear me?  

#### [0:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2370) |  JOHN MUELLER: Yes. AKILAN: I have a

question on URL structure. JOHN MUELLER: OK. AKILAN: So basically, we are following up for the [INAUDIBLE]. Of course, people are following with the naked URL and people are following with the folder level also. So as I'm seeing in US sites, most of the sites that are following the folder level structure. But in India, you see, not everyone is following the folder level structure. Yeah, the people are putting the naked URLs after their code. Of course, there is [INAUDIBLE] comparatively between the both sites. If you are just putting a naked URL, of course,  

#### [0:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2400) |  data [INAUDIBLE] is good actually. But again,

when it comes to the folder level, Google can able to crawl it properly. So that is also there. So which is good to follow? Either folder level structure or naked URL for a better ranking? JOHN MUELLER: For ranking, we don't care. So, whatever works for you. Kind of similar to the first question. I would personally go into the direction of folder level just so that you have more room to expand over time.  

#### [0:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2430) |  So, something where it's like, if you

have a clean folder structure, then you can add multiple categories without having to kind of regional all of the existing URLs. AKILAN: So if you see sites like, big sites like Amazon, they are not following that much big folder structure. But still they are ranking under the [INAUDIBLE].. So that [INAUDIBLE]. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I mean, like I said, there's no ranking advantage. It's really more a matter of, how do you deal with maintenance?  

#### [0:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2460) |  How do you change things over time?

There's no ranking advantage to having kind of like, everything in one file name versus in multiple folders. And there's also no effect of, like, if you put content below five levels or folders, it will rank worse than if you put content directly on the root of the URL. There is no effect like that. AKILAN: OK. But it was a big [INAUDIBLE] for us. Because it was sometimes it was ranking, and sometimes it was not ranking.  

#### [0:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2490) |  And the big sites like Amazon, they're

following naked URL structure. And some big sites are following the proper folder level structure. So yeah. JOHN MUELLER: I wouldn't call it proper folder level structure. I mean, if it works for a big site like Amazon, then I'm sure they put a lot of thought into it. And for them, that's the proper structure. But it's totally up to you in the end. So that's one thing where some sites like to do it in folders. Some sites like to do it everything together.  

#### [0:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2520) |  I personally like folders because it makes

maintenance a little bit easier. But, ultimately, it's totally up to you. AKILAN: So this kind of URLs were never affect in any Google algorithms right, even in future also? JOHN MUELLER: I have no idea what will happen in the future. If I could tell you what the future of the algorithms were, then I don't know. I would probably be doing something different. But-- AKILAN: Yeah, because we [INAUDIBLE] recently [INAUDIBLE] last year we got [INAUDIBLE] so much of how far even  

#### [0:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2550) |  our category pages went down. So that

[INAUDIBLE] even if folder level is as proper but naked URL is not as proper. So that was-- JOHN MUELLER: From my point of view, I don't see that changing in the future. These are just different URL structures that some sites have. Some sites use parameters, some sites use folders with file names. It's-- everyone does it slightly differently. The important part for us is that we can take that one URL that you have. We can crawl it, we can index it with that URL  

#### [0:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2580) |  and pick up the content. How you

determine which URL to use is ultimately up to you. The only thing I would watch out for is it should be, I think, less than 1,000 characters, which you probably have to work really hard to make URLs that long. AKILAN: Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Thanks, John. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. Let's see. Let me run through some of the other questions. And I think there's some questions in the chat as well.  

#### [0:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2610) |  My UX designers asked if they can

move the H font to the footer. Same with the internal links. Does this have any impact on SEO performance? From an SEO point of view, I don't think that makes a big difference. It makes it hard for us to understand what the heading is for. So that's something that probably doesn't make that much sense. And from an accessibility point of view, that sounds wrong as well. But, if you have a strong reason to put an H1 tag into the footer, then that's perfectly fine.  

#### [0:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2640) |  With HTML5, of course, they're different, what

is it, elements on a page that can have H1 tags as well. So maybe they're just saying, well, we have kind of the article, the H1 tag, and the footer with an H1 tag as well. That's perfectly fine. A website has millions of pages indexed by Google that drive mainly irrelevant traffic with low engagement, high bounce rate. How might this affect the ranking performance  

#### [0:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2670) |  of the small percentage of high quality

[INAUDIBLE],, if at all? So, I think your suspicion is probably right on here in that, if you're already seeing that a website has a lot of bad content, then you're in that situation that we talked about in the beginning. Namely, what do you do if you have a lot of bad content? In general, our algorithms do look at a site overall. So if we see that a large part of the relevant content on the page is low quality or bad content,  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1KwTPIz13XA/hq3.jpg)



#### [0:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2700) |  then we'll have trouble trusting kind of

the newer content or the rest of the content on the site. So, once you're kind of in that situation where you're recognizing that there is a lot of kind of bad content on this site, then you have those three options that we talked about. Namely, improving the content, removing the content completely, or just no indexing that content so that Google doesn't see it. Those are kind of the directions I would head there.  

#### [0:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2730) |  It's really hard to say, or imagine

what kind of situation you're in where you have millions of low quality content, or millions of pages with low quality content, and a small percentage of high quality pages. That seems like something where you've built kind of a website on kind of shaky foundation where it's probably worth thinking about, how did you end up here? And which direction do you want to go? And how do you avoid running into that situation again?  

#### [0:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2760) |  For a little over a year now,

I haven't been able to get our site maps used in Search Console. When I submit them, they immediately go to Couldn't Fetch. And I don't see any requests in our logs. Any thoughts? So, I would recommend starting a thread in our Webmaster Help Forum with the URL of your site and the [INAUDIBLE] file. And you can send me the URL of your thread. And I can double check with the team to see what exactly is happening there. We're a large publisher with a big international and mobile  

#### [0:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2790) |  audience. We're wondering if our US UK

rankings are affected by the percentage of users internationally with slower page loads. Specifically, what is it? FID, tied to interactive, tied metrics. We do look at multiple things when it comes to speed, especially on mobile. On the one hand, kind of the lab tests that we do with things like page feed insights.  

#### [0:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2820) |  On the other hand, we also look

at things like the Chrome User Experience Report data, that is kind of more aggregated and tracked on a kind of rough level. And that data is based on what users are seeing. So if a lot of your users are seeing really low performance of your website, then that's something that might be worth figuring out how you can improve there. Sometimes it's as easy as adding a CDN in where  

#### [0:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2850) |  the CDN might have endpoints in multiple

countries. And then suddenly, it's like you have a local presence in those countries. So that's kind of what I would watch out for there. We have a Google news approved news website and the content is primarily in English. We're expanding-- we're planning to also publish other language content, say Hindi. Will this effect in Google discover traffic, or the website getting unapproved from Google News? I don't know how Google News deals  

#### [0:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2880) |  with this kind of situation. I know

they're not a lot of international news sites out there. So I assume this is something that should just work. With regards to Google Discover, it's also tricky to say how that works. But, as far as I understand, it's based on normal search results there. So if these pages are indexed normally for your website, then we can try that on Google Discover, regardless of the language of your website.  

#### [0:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2910) |  Does Google ignore the URL parameters that

come after a hash? In other words, to Google, is slash categories hash some attribute the same? Yes. In general, we ignore everything after a hash. There are two exceptions. One is the hash bang, kind of the hash and then the exclamation mark, which is what was used in the old Ajax crawling scheme, which we kind of separate out individually and treat as unique URLs.  

#### [0:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2940) |  And the other exact kind of exception

is for a very, very tiny number of sites. We've recognized that URLs with a hash lead to unique content. So it's not just kind of going up and down within the page, but actually leading to unique content. And there, we do sometimes index those URLs with the hash as well. But that's extremely rare. And that's not something that I would rely on. So if you're using the hash to change  

#### [0:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=2970) |  the content of your page, I would

assume that we will crawl and index the URL without the hash for the most part. If you're using the hash to jump up and down within your page's content, then that's perfectly fine. We tend to ignore everything after the hash. So things links to the site, the indexing, all of that will be based on the non hash URL. And if there are any links to the hashed URL, then we will fold that into the non hashed URL.  

#### [0:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3000) |  All right. Let me double check what

I missed here in the chat. Is there any limit to the amount of code or JavaScript that Google will render? We have a lot of client side rendered content by JavaScript. But not all of it appears to render in the inspect URL in Search Console. There is no absolute limit to the amount of JavaScript that we will process. There are a few quirks with the testing tool,  

#### [0:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3030) |  though, that might be worth watching out

for. In particular, in the testing tools, we optimize for speed rather than completeness. And we optimize for fresh content rather than kind of like, just using anything that we have cached. That means for the testing tool, if we recognize that your page loads a lot of JavaScript and loads a lot of resources with that JavaScript, kind of using APIs to pull in content, then at some point, our algorithms or our systems might say,  

#### [0:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3060) |  we're running out of time. The user

is waiting. We need a result now. And we will kind of stop processing the JavaScript and show the user the content as it is there. So that's something where, from a practical point of view, we tend to time out fairly quickly in the testing tools. And in indexing itself, we have a lot more time because nobody is explicitly waiting for a result right away. So we will take more time to pull in out of that content.  

#### [0:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3090) |  We will try to aggressively cache JavaScript

and server responses to make sure that we can get all of that into indexing as well. If you're seeing that it's still not being processed properly in the index version, and you know you have a lot of requests that are made. So if you use something like the Chrome Inspect URL tool, look at the Network tab. And you see hundreds and hundreds of resources being pulled in, then that's something where it might make sense to figure out ways to combine those resources  

#### [0:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3120) |  and have fewer resources that are required

to render the page. OK. Let's see. Two weeks ago, someone suggested Alt text should include keywords that you're attempting to rank for. Say we are a site about roof tiles, and the picture is someone sitting in a park bench. For accessibility, a description like a person  

#### [0:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3150) |  sitting on a bench in a park.

But whoops. Keeps scrolling up. But the guess suggested it should be person on a park bench thinking about roof tiles. To me, this is bad, as the photo doesn't suggest this. I always thought Google would infer this from the image based on the content on the page that it's embedded in. I think you're totally right. It is something where I would not artificially just stuff  

#### [0:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3180) |  keywords into the Alt text. The thing

with the Alt text is kind of twofold. On the one hand, we use it as-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] JOHN MUELLER: Whoops. We use it as part of the HTML page. So, that's something that could be seen as part of the visual page. You can, of course, just make that text visible on the page. It does the same thing. The other thing that we use the Alt text for is to better understand the image. And we try to better understand the image for image search.  

#### [0:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3210) |  So if you have an image of

someone sitting on a park bench, then like, the question is, what would you expect that to rank for an image search in a way that would be useful for your website? So in particular, if someone is searching for a person sitting on a park bench, and we want to show that image, because that's kind of what it is, how would that be useful for your website kind  

#### [0:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3240) |  of in that general flow of this

person searching for someone sitting on a park bench comes to your website, sees that image and thinks, oh, that's a nice image? But they're really not interested in moving tiles. So, what is the purpose of this image with regards to image search on your website? And if it's really completely unrelated, then I don't think you have a lot of value of that traffic from someone searching for person sitting on a park bench. So it's not something that you would need to artificially improve to have  

#### [0:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3270) |  that ranking or that visibility in image

search slightly differently. It's also something where if you were to add kind of roofing tiles to that Alt text, and someone were to search for roofing tiles and see this image of a person sitting on a park bench, then they're probably not going to go to your website. Because it feels like, well, they're searching for roofing tiles. They see an image, a thumbnail for someone sitting on a park bench. That doesn't sound like what their intent is.  

#### [0:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3300) |  So I guess what I'm saying is,

if you're using images kind of in a descriptive way, then I would certainly focus on using an Alt text that works well for accessibility reasons, to make it so that those images kind of if they weren't shown, that a user who is accessing that page without those images being visible still has enough context around the content of that page. And on the other hand, if you're using images  

#### [0:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3330) |  in a way that are critical for

your site's content, well, you really want people to go from this image in image search to your content. Then obviously, make sure that we understand that this image is actually about your content. So if we have an image about roofing tiles and you have an Alt text that includes roofing tiles, that works both for accessibility reasons, as well as for image search. So those are, I think, kind of the two things that are worth differentiating. Which I think a lot of SEOs tend to focus purely on,  

#### [0:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3360) |  I need to get all of this

content into image search. And from a practical point of view, you can do that. But I don't think you get a lot of value back out of that if you just blindly put them into [INAUDIBLE] search with your keywords on there. Nobody is going to go to your website after seeing a thumbnail of a person sitting on a park bench if they want information about roofing tiles. And similarly, the people who are looking for an image of someone sitting on a park bench,  

#### [0:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3390) |  they're probably not going to go to

your website and say, oh yeah. Roofing tiles. I've wanted to buy those for a long time. Now I need to buy some. That doesn't work either. So kind of think about what you're really trying to do with image search. And I think there is a lot of potential there. And it's something that SEOs who are thinking a little bit more strategically about kind of the user journey of how users might search for content come to your website and interact  

#### [0:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3420) |  with your content, those are probably the

ones that will be able to pull this off in a way that doesn't just kind of focus on the massive images in image search. But rather, focuses on getting the right images in the right place with the right context so that users can find those and go to your website and do whatever it is that you'd like them to do there. Can Google, but read the Facebook comment on my web page.  

#### [0:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3450) |  I don't know. So, that probably depends

on how the embed is done on your web page. In general, I'd recommend using the inspect URL tool to see how your web page loads. You might even make a test page just with that embed for kind of the Facebook comments setup, so that you can test exactly that setup, and you might be able to tweak different settings or try different things out. And based on that, you'll be able to figure out, like, how can I get my comments in?  

#### [0:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3480) |  Or maybe you even decide, I don't

want my comments indexed. That's fine too. All right. I think that's pretty much it. I'm sure more questions will have dropped in in the meantime. That we're kind of out of time to handle. Yeah. Looks a bunch of stuff has happened as well.  

#### [0:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3510) |  So yeah. If there's something critical in

those new questions that you already added, feel free to copy them over to the next Hangout, and we can take a look at them there. You're also welcome, of course, to go to our Web Master Help Forum. There are lots of fantastic product experts that are active there who can kind of help you figure things out, or help discuss different options if there are different things that you want to look at. They've seen a lot of interesting, confusing, and weird websites over the years.  

#### [0:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3540) |  And can generally give you some tips

on which directions would be feasible or reasonable to go into. If there's something else, of course, you're free to reach out to us on Twitter. And if there is a short question that you'd like to have answered in video form, we're going to continue doing the Ask Google Webmasters kind a video series, which we recorded a bunch of episodes recently. So hopefully, those will be out soon. But we'll continue to make more episodes.  

#### [0:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3570) |  So feel free to continue using that

hashtag as well. All right. So, as always, thank you all for your many questions and feedback and suggestions. And on Friday, we'll be there in the next one with a slightly different layout so the links will be different. It might be a little bit confusing in the beginning. Hopefully, it works out. We'll probably have to try this a little bit to see what the optimal setup there is.  

#### [1:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KwTPIz13XA&t=3600) |  But, I'm sure we'll find a way

to make that happen. Algorithm changes don't only affect web sites. They also affect how we do these Hangouts. All right. So with that, let's take a break here. And I wish you all a great week until Friday. Bye everyone.
