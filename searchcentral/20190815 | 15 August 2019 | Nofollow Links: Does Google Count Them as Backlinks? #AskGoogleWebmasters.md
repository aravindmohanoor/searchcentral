addressing [? KapitanAdrian's ?] question. Does Google count nofollow links as backlinks? I'm seeing these links in the Link Report in Search Console, and I know for sure that they're nofollow. Hey, [? Kapitan. ?] Thanks for asking. We've already talked about the general usage of the rel="nofollow" link attribute. When our systems run across links tagged like this, we take note of them, but we don't forward any of these so-called signals to the linked pages.

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZwv8R64x2E&t=30) |  In general, this means we don't pass

any PageRank from the link source to the link target. However, it's still a link on the web, and users may be using those to reach your website. And so, in Search Console, we decided to show these as links, together with other links pointing to your site. Similarly, if you were to use a disavow links tool, those links would no longer be passing any signals but would continue to appear in the links report in Search Console.

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZwv8R64x2E&t=60) |  In short, links with a rel="nofollow" don't

pass any signals to your website. But they will still be shown in the Search Console links report. I hope you have found this video useful and insightful.
