#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOrOPDcGRO0&t=0) |  [MUSIC PLAYING] JOHN MUELLER: Today's question is

from Dan. He's asking, is there any plan to eventually let webmasters tell Google they want to be included in the mobile-first index, or at least be considered for inclusion? Some nonresponsive sites might believe their mobile site is more SEO friendly than their desktop site. Mobile-first indexing is a process of indexing websites using a smartphone-like user agent. We started working on this a few years ago

using smartphones. Mobile-first indexing is separate from mobile friendliness. Even sites that don't have a mobile version at all can be indexed fine with a mobile Googlebot. Our goal is to use the mobile-first indexing for all websites in our search results. We're taking our time to make sure that users will continue to be able to find what they're looking for and to help site owners to adapt, should there be something they need to do. We've found that, for the most part,

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOrOPDcGRO0&t=60) |  sites can be indexed fine with a

mobile device. At the moment, we're algorithmically testing to see when sites are ready and switching them over once that's the case. To determine when a site is ready, we compare the mobile and desktop versions to make sure that we're still able to find all of the content, including structure data and images. With the longer-term goal of moving all sites over to mobile-first indexing, we don't plan to provide an opt-in or opt-out for this kind of indexing.

have a bunch of documentation and blog posts that are linked in the description below. See you in the next episode of Ask Google Webmasters. Until then-- [MUSIC PLAYING]
