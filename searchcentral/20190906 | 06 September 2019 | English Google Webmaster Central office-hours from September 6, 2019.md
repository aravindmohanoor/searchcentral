#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=0) |  JOHN MUELLER: All right, welcome, everyone, to

today's Webmaster Central Office Hours Hang out. My name is John Mueller. I am a webmaster trends analyst here at Google in Switzerland, and part of what we do are these Webmaster Office Hours Hang Outs, where webmasters, and SEOs, and interested people can join in and ask their questions around web search. As always, a bunch of things were submitted already, but you're welcome--  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=30) |  any of you here are welcome to

kind of jump in and ask the first questions if there's anything on your mind that you want to start with. AMOS GRIMA: Good morning, John. Hi. It's Amos here. JOHN MUELLER: Good morning. AMOS GRIMA: I have a question about Google for jobs. So we recently migrated away from a third party that was hosting our jobs board, and we moved that on to our own website. And we lost the majority of our Google for jobs traffic  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=60) |  when we did the migration. Now all

of the technical setup is actually correct, so we checked also with the guys at Google, three or four of them. And they said, yeah, everything's perfect, but they said there's a ranking problem. So we're sort of in the blind. We don't really know what the problem is. The content is exactly the same as it was on the jobs board we migrated away from, so any kind of direction you can provide would be really helpful. JOHN MUELLER: I don't really know much about Google  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=90) |  for Jobs other than that there's a

markup and that you can use the indexing API. Is this all on the same domain, or did you move to a different domain? AMOS GRIMA: It's exactly the same domain. We just had a kind of a CMS that was on a different provider. It was [INAUDIBLE]. They're specialized in job boards, and we decided to actually bring that into our own platform. JOHN MUELLER: OK, and you noticed the change  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=120) |  in traffic right about the time when

you switched over, or-- AMOS GRIMA: Yes, it was pretty much immediate. So when we did switch, everything was obviously [INAUDIBLE] and redirected, and everything went pretty smoothly. But the Google for job is the part that really just dropped off. JOHN MUELLER: OK. If you can drop maybe some sample URLs into the chat, I can take a look at that later on. I don't really know much about the Google for job side or if there is anything kind of weird ranking related on there,  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=150) |  but I'm happy to take a look

and poke at the team to see if there's something-- at least if there's something technical that you can fix. AMOS GRIMA: OK, thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. SAIDUL HOQUE: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. SAIDUL HOQUE: We recently have got a question from one of our clients. I think you answered this before, but I want confirmation from you again.  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=180) |  The client has H1 tags on all

the web pages he has. Only the home page doesn't have the H1 tag. Now someone, some agency, told him that it is bad for his search engine ranking. It will impact badly the [INAUDIBLE] ranking, but I tried to ensure him that it is not [INAUDIBLE].. So just I want to know how important the H1 tag for a web page to rank on Google.  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=210) |  JOHN MUELLER: So headings in general help

us to better understand the context of the pages. So it's something that I wouldn't see it as a critical ranking factor. And for things like the home page, usually you would rank for the company name anyway, and that's not a matter of are you ranking well or not. Your company is probably the only page that is relevant for that query anyway. With H1 tags, we see it a little bit like making text bold  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=240) |  on a page. It helps us to

better understand this is really important on this page. Some people have multiple sections that are bold. If you have the whole page that is bold, then obviously we think, well, if everything is important, nothing is important, so it doesn't help that much. But you can give us this extra information in lots of different ways. It doesn't have to be a H1 tag. So I wouldn't see it as a critical thing, but it seems like one of those things that  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=270) |  is trivial to fix and to add.

So I would just take care of it, and then you don't have to worry about it anymore. I think a lot of SEO tools check for the H1 headings in general, so if you use other tools, they will flag it otherwise as well. SAIDUL HOQUE: And the second question, one of our clients want to move his [INAUDIBLE] site to a new domain, so now we are going to do all the [INAUDIBLE] from the old domain to new domain.  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=300) |  But just our concern, does it affect

their site ranking if we do another domain? JOHN MUELLER: Maybe. Maybe. So-- yeah, so in general, site migrations can be tricky. So if you're moving purely from one domain to another, and all of the URLs stay the same within the website, and you have set up the proper redirect, and you follow all of the guidelines,  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=330) |  then usually that's a matter of maybe

a day or two where things get a little bit uncertain, and otherwise, it works out well. If you move to a different domain and things like country code top level domains come into play, or if you change the content on the side, or the kind of internal setup of the website, then that's a pretty complex move, and that's something that usually takes quite a bit of time to settle down. SAIDUL HOQUE: OK, thank you.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=360) |  PAUL: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. PAUL:

Hi, it's Paul here. I have a question. If you were making a decision, would you go PWA or AMP, or would you do both? JOHN MUELLER: Oh my gosh. Which of my children do I like best, right? PAUL: That's the kind of answer. JOHN MUELLER: Oh my gosh. I don't know. So from my point of view, it feels like there are slightly different things in the sense that a PWA in general,  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=390) |  you can use it to make something

that is more like an app, which means that you kind of have a different setup on the website in general, so it's less a matter of you're just providing content. So I could imagine that makes sense if you have more interactive elements on a page, if you care about things like offline accessibility, all of those kind of traditionally PWA level things,  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=420) |  whereas with AMP, I think it's a

great platform for publishing content. It makes it really easy to get stuff out there. If you need to do interactive things, there are also ways you could do that, but it's kind of a little bit trickier. So that's kind of where I would try to make the call initially. Like, are you primarily just publishing content? Then probably AMP is a good setup. Are you planning on doing something interactive where you have calculators or other kind  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=450) |  of interactive elements on the site? Do

you need to be available offline? I don't know. If you have a train schedule, for example, that you just want people to have accessible regardless where they are, then obviously PWA is a good choice. Another thing, I think, is worth keeping in mind is that setting up a PWA can be quite complex. So in general, if you're doing this in-house, if you're creating it yourself, then you  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=480) |  need some pretty savvy developers who can

do all of this work with the JavaScript frameworks, who can make sure that this JavaScript based PWA will also work well in search, whereas with AMP, you can pretty much use existing plug ins. If you have to code it yourself, the code is pretty easy. It's a great way to kind of get started making web pages. So if you have fewer developers in house and especially  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=510) |  if you're mostly publishing content, then I

would go towards AMP. If you want to do something crazy fancy, then maybe PWA is the right approach. PAUL: OK, thanks. ANDREW SYCHEV: Hello, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. ANDREW SYCHEV: Hello, everyone. I have a question regarding mobile first indexing mostly I guess. So I have a client who has a site with dynamic serving,  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=540) |  so that's the way site appear on

smartphones and desktops and need to be exactly the same with all text, images, graphics, et cetera. JOHN MUELLER: It doesn't have to be exactly the same, but with mobile first indexing, we'll only index the mobile version of the page. So if there is content on the desktop version that is important for you and it's not available at all on the mobile version, then we wouldn't index that with mobile first indexing.  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=570) |  So that's primarily what I would watch

out for. It doesn't have to be exactly the same. Sometimes people write it shorter for mobile because it's easier to read. Sometimes they have smaller images or different layout. That's perfectly fine. ANDREW SYCHEV: OK, so will Google switch site to a mobile first if it has slightly different content on desktops and smartphones? JOHN MUELLER: We have a classifier that tries to recognize if the content is similar enough.  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=600) |  It's not that it has to be

identical, so we would probably still switch it over. If everything else is OK and the content is just slightly different, then we would probably still switch it over. ANDREW SYCHEV: OK, thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. All right, let me run through some of the questions that were submitted, and if you have questions along the way, feel free to jump on in as well.  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=630) |  Let's see. The first question is about

material design icons. It's a pretty long question, but basically, with the material design kind of recommendations from the framework, it looks like the way to embed these icons is to have an I element so kind of italics text element with a specific class and then the text name of the icon.  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=660) |  And the question is, well, these appear

to be showing up in our meta descriptions, or in the snippets, in the search results, what can I do about this? Is this a bug in Google search or a material design? I took a quick look at this beforehand to kind of try to see what is happening here, and essentially from the search side, we see this as text  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=690) |  within the page. So you're trying to

display an icon, but it's essentially text on the page. So we try to index as text on the page, and we show it in the snippet if appropriate. We might make it available if people search for it explicitly. So from that point of view, this is probably not an ideal setup if you're putting these icons between important text on your page that you need to have index or that you think would make sense to be shown in the snippet.  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=720) |  There are two things that you can

do to make this a little bit better. On the one hand, specify your own meta description using the description meta tag, and we can try to pick that up and use that. On the other hand, looking at the material design site, there's also a way that you can specify these icons using a code point where instead of the text name, you specify kind of a number that refers to that specific icon that you're trying to show.  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=750) |  And we would essentially see that as

a single kind of strange character, and that wouldn't have the same effect as if you write out keyboard error left for example. So those are kind of the two directions that I'd recommend there. I will follow up with the material design team though to see if we can make this a little bit better in the sense that it will just work well for search. I'm kind of surprised that this is the first time this has come up because it seems like something that anyone  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=780) |  who is using material design might potentially

see. Let's see. My site has a configuration of separate URLs, and it's a pretty long question. So basically, they have a www version that's for desktop and an m. version that's for mobile, and sometimes they see the mobile version in the search results.  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=810) |  From our point of view, that can

sometimes happen with-- especially with mobile first indexing. That's similar to before, where sometimes on mobile you would see a desktop URL in the search results even though you have kind of this connection between the two versions setup. So the things I would watch out for here are, first of all, make sure that you have the connection between those two versions set up properly so that we can pick that up.  

#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=840) |  And then secondly, make sure that you

redirect from the mobile version to the desktop version if the user is a desktop user, so that's something that's often easier to setup on the server side, where if you can recognize it's a desktop browser, redirect from the mobile version to the desktop version. Similarly, a mobile browser going to the desktop site, they would be redirected to the mobile version. With both of these setups, it's easier for us  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=870) |  to recognize that, and if we happen

to show the mobile version in the search results, it wouldn't cause any problems. So it's not something that you need to worry about. I think in the long run, the best approach here is to go down the direction of either responsive design or dynamic serving, where you have a single URL that serves all users instead of having multiple URLs that are valid for individual users. So long term I would go towards a single URLs solution.  

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=900) |  In the short term I would set

up the links and definitely the redirects. If you have the redirect setup, then you don't need to worry about the mobile page sometimes being shown in search. Why does Google index 404 pages? We don't, so if a page returns a 404 error code, then we will not index that page's content. There are two things that might be something  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OmECfzfmdyQ/maxres1.jpg)



#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=930) |  that you're seeing here, so I don't

know exactly which pages you're looking at. It might be that a page has recently turned 404, and in that case, if we haven't seen that the page returns a 404, then we won't know that it's a 404. So that might be something that's happening. The other thing that sometimes happens is that the server shows a 404 page, but the result code that's shown to crawlers is actually 200. And 200 means, OK, that this page is OK to be shown,  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=960) |  OK to be indexed, and if we

don't recognize that the text on this page says, oh, wait, there is an error here, then we might index that page separately. So if you have custom error pages, make sure they return 404. If this is your site and you've recently removed content, then sometimes it just takes a while for all of that to kind of drop out of the index.  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=990) |  Is it true that top level domains

are best for ranking? No. You can rank your content on any kind of domain. It can be on a subdomain. It can be on a subdirectory. That's totally up to you. Sometimes it's even tricky to recognize what a top level domain is because some-- I think some country versions have something set up that looks like a unique top level domain, but it's actually a subdomain.  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1020) |  So it's definitely not the case that

only top level domains are best for ranking. If you're creating content on your own, what I would recommend, however, is that you use your own domain name for hosting your content. By using your own domain name, you're kind of making sure that regardless of what infrastructure you're working on, you can keep your content and keep that in search, you can continue building on your own website, whereas if you use a subdomain, for example, from Blogger or--  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1050) |  I don't know-- any of the other

hosting platforms, if, at some point, you say, well, Blogger isn't enough for me-- I want to do something fancy, then you have to do a site migration. You have to migrate that subdomain from Blogger to some other domain or subdomain, whereas if you use your own domain for hosting and you decide, well, Blogger isn't enough for me-- I need to use something fancier, then you can continue using your domain,  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1080) |  and you just need to watch out

that these URLs remain the same. Is Google bot degrading site's traffic, which work like automated programs? So the question is pretty complicated. I think what this site essentially does is automatically generate pages that match what a user was looking for.  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1110) |  In many cases, that comes off as

being very spammy. If you're automatically generating kind of textual content based on some things I once search for, then that could be seen as an auto generated page, which the web spam team could take action on and say, well, I don't know if this is really useful content. In this case, it's automatically generating a ringtone based on kind of the text that people enter, which-- I don't know-- sounds pretty neat to me.  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1140) |  So I haven't tried it out, but

it sounds pretty useful and neat. But with regards to search, this generally wouldn't be something where we'd say this is bad because we can look at the content. Even someone manually looks at the content. They can say, well, there is something kind of useful that's being provided here. It's not just a matter of someone kind of copying pasting the same text over and over again or automatically generating some text.  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1170) |  That said, if you're automatically generating pages

based on things that users enter, then you quickly run into the situation that the amount of pages on your site explodes, the kind of the value of each individual page is questionable because you don't even know what people have entered, and it's possible that users enter some really crazy stuff that you don't want to be found for. So perhaps someone goes in there and says, I would like to generate a page for--  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1200) |  I don't know-- Mihai the world's best

SEO. And then that could come out as, well, your site is promoting Mihai as the world's best SEO, whereas, actually, you just want to provide a ringtone. So my recommendation there when it comes to user generated content, find a way that you can filter out kind of the high quality stuff and separate it from all of the rest because you want to be found for the high quality stuff.  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1230) |  And you want to make sure that

search engines, when they look at your site overall, they see, well, all of this stuff is really high quality stuff, therefore maybe this is actually a really good website to show, whereas if search engines go there and say, well, there's some good stuff here, but there's this big pile of junk that people have just submitted, then they might say, well, overall, this website-- I don't know-- is hard to see as something being fantastic.  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1260) |  Not to say that Mihai is not

a good SEO though. I know Google doesn't penalize for duplicate content. I heard that in one of the videos, but what about spun content? Does Google penalize for using spun content? Yes, so anytime you're using auto generated content to create pages, textual pages like that, that would be considered against our webmaster guidelines,  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1290) |  so that's something that I would definitely

try to avoid. There are common setups that the web spam team runs across every now and then. On the one hand, pages that are completely auto generated, where you just have a few seed words and then it goes off and generates a big tree of text, that is essentially just trying to target those words and has no value at all for users. Then other common use cases we see are scripts that take existing content on the web  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1320) |  and they just swap out individual words.

That's also seen as spun content and would be against our webmaster guidelines. And then there are cases where people take existing content and just translate into other languages often using automated translating tools. Sometimes they translate it back to make it look like it's actually English again or whatever language it originally was, and that would also be seen as automatically generated content and against our webmaster guidelines.  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1350) |  The web spam team, generally, when they

run across situations like this, they do take action, and that can be action anywhere from the site is not showing up so well on search to the site is completely removed from search when we think there is really no value at all in that site. PAUL: John, I have a question about this because on these automated tools, we sometimes see that our images are pulled into these spammy pages and using  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1380) |  our own hosted images. They're not downloading

them and reuploading them. And does this have a negative effect on SEO because we're associated with this page or-- JOHN MUELLER: No. PAUL: --not really? OK. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, that's a common setup. They just scrape stuff from image search, and they take it directly from those web pages and show that. Yeah. And, I mean, sometimes we don't catch this right. Sometimes our algorithms don't pick it up properly. It's useful to have a spam report if you run across things  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1410) |  like this or if you run across

a bigger setup that just seems to keep working, then maybe you send me a note. But for the most part, this is something that is very widespread, and we have a lot of experience with that. Internationalization duplicate content, a site is multi regional and all in one language with the correct hreflang and canonical setup,  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1440) |  but Google is increasingly choosing its own

canonical. Does that mean it's because the content is the same, that it's seeing it as duplicate content? Yes. If the content is the same, then it's seen as duplicate content. That's kind of, I guess, the definition of duplicate content. When it comes to international sites like this, what generally happens is we would pick one URLs as a canonical, and we would use the hreflang annotations to swap out  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1470) |  the appropriate URL in the search results.

So indexing-wise, we try to focus on one version because it's all the same, and in the search results, we would just swap out the URL. So usually-- RASIDA: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: --that's OK. Yeah. Hi. RASIDA: Hi. That was my question. So our site is multi-regional, but it's in one language as you said. However, we do have the correct hreflang set up and canonical, and we've seen this increase quite suddenly.  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1500) |  So it's only happening in one market.

Like you said, because it's the same, it's seeing it as duplicate that the increase is all of a sudden. So I was thinking is there something behind it. We've spoken to our dev team, and we've seen that there's been an increase in the API pages being crawled. So we were just trying to understand what is the reason for the sudden change.  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1530) |  JOHN MUELLER: It might not be anything

on your side. So what sometimes happens is our algorithms, over time, will try to re-evaluate what is actually duplicate content. For example, if the bulk of the page is the same and the footer is slightly different, then it might be that our algorithms will, at some point, say, well, actually, these are the same, and then you might see a shift like that. So it's not necessarily something that you're doing wrong. It might just be our algorithms suddenly recognizing, oh, wait,  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1560) |  this is all the same. RASIDA: Despite

having correct hreflang and canonical, it's just the same content. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, so usually what happens is in the search results, we would show the right URL. So it's not that anything is broken or you're seeing kind of lower traffic there, but it is confusing if you look at things like the search console index coverage report or the performance report. Both of those focus on the canonical URLs, and if we pick one version as a canonical,  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1590) |  then we'll have all of the data

there. And it might be a different canonical depending on the page. So it could, for example-- I'm just making this up. Maybe you're about page, we pick the UK version as the canonical, and your terms of service page, we picked the Australian page as canonical. So that's something that makes it a little bit tricky. If you have a single domain with the country versions  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1620) |  as subdomains or subdirectories, you can use

search console kind of on the domain level to get the full picture. If you have multiple separate domains for individual country TLDs, then you need to manually calculate the appropriate numbers in a cross search console. There's no real way to get a overview there. RASIDA: OK, great. So is the solution in future-- I know it doesn't hamper our performance in rankings  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1650) |  and traffic, but moving forward, is it

just best to have those markets translated in their correct language? JOHN MUELLER: I mean, translated is probably the best in the long run anyway. The question that I don't really have a great answer for is should you kind of artificially change the content across? Like, say you have multiple English pages. Should you artificially shift sentences around so that they're not seen as duplicate?  

#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1680) |  Theoretically, you can do that. We probably

wouldn't see it as duplicates anymore. It would be easier to track. From kind of a practical point of view, I don't know if that would change anything in your search results. It would just essentially make it easier for tracking. RASIDA: OK, great. Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. I've read that Google only takes a number of backlinks rather than a number of high DA backlinks for ranking.  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1710) |  Is that true at least currently? So

we don't use DA at all when it comes to search. So this is a metric created by a third party company. I think it's cool that companies create different metrics to kind of try to evaluate how a website is doing across search, but we don't use DA at all.  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1740) |  Anything like domain authority, the metric provided

by other companies, is not something that has anything to do with Google search. So from that point of view, if you want to use this metric on your site to compare things and it helps you to better understand how your website fits in with the rest of the web, got for it. But I would not assume that this is something that has anything to do with regards to Google search. Does Google have any red flag if a site  

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1770) |  is using an old PHP version? No,

we don't. So what can sometimes happen, depending on the setup and what is happening on our side at the time, we may send out messages through search console to sites that are using either kind of an older server version or an older CMS version. Say you have an old WordPress version installed. It might be that we send you a message and say like, hey, be aware there are vulnerabilities out there  

#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1800) |  for this setup that you have running,

and it's possible that you'll get hacked. And we recommend that you update as urgently as possible. So that's something that can happen, and it can certainly happen if you're running an older version that is not patched appropriately that your site gets hacked. And getting hacked has its whole set of hassles that are attached to it, and so I try to avoid that if at all possible. But it's not the case that there is any kind of a ranking effect  

#### [0:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1830) |  or any kind of red flag on

our side that we'd say, oh, it looks like they're running an old PHP version, therefore we shouldn't show this site as high in the search results. Is there any risk in pointing parked domains to our live website? No, that's perfectly fine. I would not assume that you're getting any value out of redirecting all of these parked domains to your website. But I have seen cases where people use them, for example, for marketing reasons.  

#### [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1860) |  So if you're doing some kind of

offline advertising, then maybe you'll pick a certain domain name that redirects your main website as the URL that you would show there, and that's perfectly fine. It makes it easier for you to track how that's performing, so I wouldn't mind just doing that. Mute you. In one of Google's patents, I've read  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OmECfzfmdyQ/maxres2.jpg)



#### [0:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1890) |  about a new page rank concept that

is very intriguing. It's about seed pages being used to calculate page rank so a few questions about that. In general, I don't really have anything to say publicly about any of the patents that we have. A lot of these patents are done in the sense of kind of we ran across this really cool concept, and we would like to patent it so that it's clear that kind  

#### [0:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1920) |  of nobody else can take it. So

that's something that doesn't necessarily mean that we would use that directly in search. There are tons of patents out there. Bill Slavski, he runs a blog that covers all of these really cool patents, and I'm always amazed at the cool stuff that people at Google are working on. But I wouldn't assume that just because there is a patent out there that this is how Google search works.  

#### [0:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1950) |  I was recently approached by a company

promising great rankings through the use of their plug in. Apparently, it allows them to publish content on my site and on other client's site. The plug in also creates what they call a network of SEO links between their client's sites. The content isn't quite hidden. It's only linked through the copyright link in the footer. This screams bad news to me, but they claim to have over 39,000 clients and 50,000  

#### [0:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=1980) |  domains in the network. And nobody is

being banned. Is this a legit practice or a case of run, Forrest, run? So I love that last part, and I would kind of agree with that. If essentially this plug in automatically generates content for your site, that kind of goes into the area we've talked about before, and if it automatically generates this kind of network between other sites,  

#### [0:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2010) |  then it's kind of a linked network.

I mean, well, it's not kind of. It is a linked network. Then that's something that the web spam team, when they run across that, they will take action on. And it's not necessarily the case that we would remove all of these sites from search. So you might still be able to find them in search, but we would definitely take action on this network. And we would make sure that all of these artificial links, which are only there because you're using this plug in,  

#### [0:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2040) |  that they're taken care of. And this

is something that's not particularly novel. It's like, I think, when I started in SEO-- what was it-- maybe-- I don't know-- 15 years ago, there were various kind of linked networks out there that were doing essentially the same thing. So that's something that, for a long time, has been clearly seen as a bad thing that goes against our webmaster guidelines. So I would stay far away from something like this.  

#### [0:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2070) |  Anyway to help for new search console

index coverage errors if Google could tell us what the errors are? I have 520 errors with submitted and has a crawl issue. Desperately trying to find a fix, but it can't figure out what's wrong. The page comes up fine, but validation fails. So I think what would be really useful here is to have some sample your URLs and probably what would work  

#### [0:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2100) |  out here is to take this question

and post it in the Webmaster Help Forum. So the folks in the Webmaster Help Forum have a ton of experience with these kind of problems, and they can quickly help you to narrow things down. So it might be a case that there was just, like, a temporary crawling problem that essentially you don't need to worry about because it's kind of come and gone again. It might also be the case that there  

#### [0:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2130) |  is something systematic on your website that

is preventing Google from being able to crawl these URLs. And there are a number of ways that you can test these pages using maybe the inspect URL tool, and search console, using other tools as well, and by kind of getting help from other people who have done similar things, it's a lot easier to narrow things down and to figure out what exactly is the problem here. And at the same time, you also learn  

#### [0:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2160) |  how to kind of diagnose these types

of issues, which is, I think, always a good skill to have. So I'd recommend taking this with some sample URLs, maybe some queries or screenshots even, and posting it in the Webmaster Help Forums. What happens if we disallow the robots.txt by robots.txt? Then everything explodes. No, not quite. So essentially, we will still have  

#### [0:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2190) |  to fetch the robots.txt to be able

to see the robots.txt. So disallowing the robots.txt file in robots.txt does not change much with regards to the requests made to the robots.txt file. It does prevent indexing of the content of the robots.txt file though, so what you would see is if someone linked to your robots.txt file in the sense of, well, maybe this is an interesting page to show, which probably it isn't, then technically, we  

#### [0:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2220) |  might go off and try to index

the robots.txt file, and we could theoretically show that the search results if someone is searching for a way that clearly looked for this robots.txt file. And if you block crawling of the robots.txt file in robots.txt, then we would still show that URL in search. We would just say-- have this snippet saying, well, we can't give you any more information because we can't crawl this page. So practically speaking, I don't think anything will change.  

#### [0:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2250) |  I don't think you make things any

more complicated, or harder, or anything, but it's kind of unnecessary. You don't really need to do it. It's similar, for example, if you want to block all crawling of a website. You would use disallow colon and then slash. That would also block crawling of the robots.txt file, but I think blocking it explicitly doesn't really make much sense.  

#### [0:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2280) |  It adds a little bit more complexity

to your robots.txt file. And a year later, you'll be like, what was I thinking? Like, there must be a reason for me to block the robots.txt file when perhaps you're just doing it for a bit of fun. My blog is so and so. I am writing quality content for my readers. Currently, I don't have a lot of traffic. Let's see. Recently, my blog was approved for AdSense.  

#### [0:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2310) |  Still I choose not to show ads

because I'm worried about the quality of my traffic. I'm trying to look at my articles again and again. What can I do to better present my site to users? I don't know. So I took a quick look at your site. It seems like a pretty reasonable site. It's really hard to say what exactly you should be doing differently. What I'd recommend doing is maybe  

#### [0:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2340) |  going through the SEO starter guides that

are out there-- there is one from us. There are a bunch from other people as well-- and kind of going through to make sure that you have everything covered. On the one hand, there are things around the way that you present the content on your site. Maybe you're doing well there. Maybe the content that you're writing is fairly well. On the other hand, there are also ways that you can kind of help promote that content and get it out there so that other people talk about it, and so that other people have a chance  

#### [0:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2370) |  to find it, and link to it

if they find it useful, all of these things. It's sometimes tricky to get started. I think it's also really tricky to get started [INAUDIBLE] and kind of start with an SEO topic on a blog because there are lots of SEO blogs out there. It's really hard to kind of differentiate one blog from another sometimes. So that's something where my first thought when  

#### [0:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2400) |  looking at your site was maybe it

would make sense to find a topic where you're really passionate about that's not something that's already extremely well covered in the industry, and to kind of find your audience there, and to start off with a small audience that really loves your content and grow that step by step rather than starting off completely fresh and saying, well, I want to create an SEO blog like all of these hundreds of others that are out there because if you're kind of starting off  

#### [0:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2430) |  completely fresh and you want to compete

with this giant set of other sites, then that's going to be really, really hard. That's not something that you can just kind of tweak by having some nice blog posts on your website. You really need to provide something unique and compelling across your site as well. Google-- AKILAN: Hey, John. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. AKILAN: Oh, sorry. I have a question.  

#### [0:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2460) |  So, John, we know that a Google

bot aren't able to crawl the infinite scroll pages, right? But my question is, how can Google bot be able to figure out all the URLs to all the links in the [INAUDIBLE] pages. Like, someone said members only. So is there any other way that Google bot can crawl all the infinite scroll links. JOHN MUELLER: We have a blog post on infinite scroll. I will take a look at that. There are some techniques that you can do where you show paginated links  

#### [0:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2490) |  on the bottom of the page, for

example, and then we can follow those paginated links as well. So I'd definitely check that out. I think it's maybe three or four years old in the meantime, but it's still valid. AKILAN: OK, so I have another question. So-- JOHN MUELLER: Go for it. AKILAN: But, yeah, if you see there are a number of headers  

#### [0:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2520) |  and footer links are there in each

and every website. So another Google bot crawls, how we do consider the head and footer links because your Google bot will crawl from the top to the end of the page. So how we do consider the headers and footer links? It will crawl each and every page as [INAUDIBLE] links, or it will just give the headers and footers and it will just crawl the remaining links. Does it affect the crawl budget? JOHN MUELLER: We do try to crawl all of the links on a page regardless of whether they're in the header or the footer. It's something-- if you're linking your site  

#### [0:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2550) |  in the header, if you have a

menu on top, then that's a great way for us to kind of crawl through the website. So it's not a matter of where those links are. It's essentially just that these links exist. The thing to keep in mind with regards to headers, and footers, and sidebars is that, generally speaking, these are repeated across the website. So from our point of view, we see them as something that's not critical to that specific page.  

#### [0:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2580) |  So we understand these belong to your

site. We can still crawl them. We think there is probably good content here, but when we try to index pages and show them in the search results, we try to focus on the primary element on the page. So if you have a blog post, for example, we'll try to take that blog post and treat that as the primary element. And the headers and footers, we'll follow the links. We know they kind of exist, but it's not seen as critical as that primary blog post  

#### [0:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2610) |  that you have in the middle. AKILAN:

OK, so I have one final question. JOHN MUELLER: Mm-hmm. AKILAN: So, yeah, so in our site, we have a number of old [INAUDIBLE] So let's say I have 1,000 URLs. Those are links of all [INAUDIBLE] on my website. So does it affect my new category which is redirected? Does it affect the ranking of a new category? JOHN MUELLER: No, it wouldn't affect the ranking.  

#### [0:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2640) |  That, definitely not. It could potentially make

it harder to crawl your website. So in particular, if we need more than five redirect hops to find the final page, then we will try to recrawl that in a second step. If you just have a collection of redirects from one old page to the new page,  

#### [0:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2670) |  then that's perfectly fine. If you have

maybe two steps in between, that's perfectly fine. If you have more than five steps, then that's something that I would avoid. In general, I recommend making sure that your redirects go as direct as possible just to kind of avoid running into a situation where you go from two to three to four, and then, suddenly, you have seven or 10 redirect hops, which make things a lot harder for us to crawl. AKILAN: OK, thanks, John. JOHN MUELLER: Sure.  

#### [0:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2700) |  Yeah, there's still a few questions left,

but maybe I can just switch over to you all. What else is on your mind? What can I help with? LENE HEGLAND: Hey, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. LENE HEGLAND: I asked a question in the chat, but I can ask it here. We have syndicated some of our content on a new website  

#### [0:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2730) |  with another website, but they are outranking

us. We've added our canonical tag, but, still, they're winning. Is there another way to avoid this apart from adding a no index on the other website? Because they really want more traffic apart from organic traffic since it's a new website, but I'm afraid it's hurting us since it's no longer--  

#### [0:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2760) |  what do you call it-- the content

will be duplicated, so it's no longer unique. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. So generally, it wouldn't harm your website in this kind of situation, so I think that part is kind of fine. But anytime you syndicate content to other sites, it can potentially happen that they outrank you, so that's something that is always worth keeping in mind.  

#### [0:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2790) |  I think it's also something that-- I

don't know-- both a risk and an opportunity in that sense in that it could be that your site is ranking number three, and if they kind of syndicate the content for you and they can rank number one, then suddenly your content is a lot more visible than if it was just on your website. But at the same time, it's also a little bit of a risk in that maybe you want people to go to your website instead of to their website.  

#### [0:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2820) |  So that's, I think, always something to

keep in mind when you're syndicating content or when you have affiliate relationships. If you kind of have resellers that sell your product, it can happen that any of these other people that are essentially reusing your product or reusing your content, that they rank above you, and there is no kind of meta tag at Google where we'd say this is the original. You have to show us at number one, not the other. people.

#### [0:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2850) |  The rel canonical helps us a little

bit there, but it doesn't guarantee that we will always follow that. So I don't really have a solution there. I think it's something where you kind of need to probably discuss internally and think about do we want our content to be visible like this, or do we need to make sure that people only go to our website? LENE HEGLAND: OK, but it's not hurting us. JOHN MUELLER: Exactly. LENE HEGLAND: OK. JOHN MUELLER: It's not hurting you.  

#### [0:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2880) |  It's not that your website would be

ranking lower because of this kind of syndication setup. LENE HEGLAND: OK, great. Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. All right, I mean, we still have time. I can run through some of the submitted questions, but sometimes it's more interesting with live questions if there's anything from any of you all. MIHAI APERGHIS: I can add something if that's fine. JOHN MUELLER: All right. MIHAI APERGHIS: It's regarding the how to structure data  

#### [0:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2910) |  markup. I'm wondering for more complex content,

for more technical content perhaps, where you kind of lay out the steps you need to take to do something, but you also have to include a lot of maybe more in depth explanations-- but you don't really want to include that in the how to markup because it kind of makes it a lot bigger, and you don't really have the right  

#### [0:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2940) |  attributes to kind of include that-- so

I'm wondering if the content is not exactly the same-- so maybe it's more of a summary of steps within the markup, is that still fine, or does it need to be a one to one exact match? JOHN MUELLER: I think that would probably still be fine. So on the one hand, it's something manually  

#### [0:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=2970) |  if we look at that, that would

probably be fine. Algorithmically, I could imagine that our algorithms might be a little bit confused if they say this isn't the markup, and this is visible on the page, and it doesn't match. If in the markup you're providing a subset of what you're showing on the page, then I don't see a problem with that. So if you have something like how to steps and you say here's the first step  

#### [0:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3000) |  and then click here to see the

rest, I generally wouldn't see a problem with that. MIHAI APERGHIS: And one more thing I'm wondering, so for a more technical IT related content like where you actually need to run-- you have an example run this command, maybe install Python on Ubuntu or something like that, and you need to run this, and this, and this, does that need need to be included?  

#### [0:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3030) |  The actual lines of the actual commands,

do they need to be included within the markup, or how would you go about this? JOHN MUELLER: That's totally up to you. I think that depends a lot on the website and on your goals. So if, for example, you need to get that information out and you don't really need to have people visit your page, put it in a markup. If, on the other hand, it's really important for you to have people visiting your page, maybe that's how you track your metrics,  

#### [0:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3060) |  your performance, maybe you have ads on

the page, then that's something where you might say, well, I'll limit the amount of content I have in the markup so that it encourages people to visit my page instead. I think there are totally valid use cases for both of those directions. For example, if someone is looking for your opening hours, they don't need to visit your page. They want to come and visit you in person. They just need to have the opening hours, whereas if someone is interested in potentially hiring you  

#### [0:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3090) |  because you're an expert on this topic,

then probably you don't want to expose all of the kind of secrets that you know directly in the markup directly. You want people to visit your page and learn about kind of the fancy things that you've been doing. MIHAI APERGHIS: So for example, if I have a command like Git and to take the latest version of Python, maybe it should be better to just include in the markup use Git or get the latest version from GitHub and not actually include the actual line of--  

#### [0:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3120) |  yeah. So that's fine as well. JOHN

MUELLER: That's totally up to you, and that's something that I would certainly test and see. Like given the number of impressions that you get, are you getting the clicks that you think are useful? And kind of double check your other metrics as well to figure out those people who are coming to my pages, are they actually relevant users, or are these people who are basically confused and just need something to copy and paste,  

#### [0:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3150) |  and they will disappear again, and never

come back? Like, I don't know. It really depends on what you're trying to achieve. MIHAI APERGHIS: OK, I just want to make sure that Google, as you mentioned, doesn't get confused. Well, you're saying this in the markup, but the content is a bit different if I look on the actual page. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I think if the markup is a subset of your actual content, I don't see a problem with that. If it's completely different, then that might be something where algorithms say, well, wait a minute. This doesn't match what's on the page.  

#### [0:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3180) |  We don't know if this markup is

really important to be shown directly in the search results. MIHAI APERGHIS: OK, I'll test it out. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. Cool. There's a question in the chat from someone in a noisy environment. I have experience with, I think, e-commerce apparel sites, and this is the first time I'm encountering a site from a manufacturing company. The site's structure is not set up in a way that the product detail pages only  

#### [0:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3210) |  contain one product like I usually see

for a typical e-commerce sites. Is it common for manufacturing companies to set up their site structures so that multiple-- so in this case, four specific products-- are shown on a single product detail page? Is there a big effect for SEO friendliness and ease of crawling if each product has their own respective product detail pages and not bundled into one page for multiple products?  

#### [0:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3240) |  In general, if the content is on

your site, then we can show it in the search results. So it's not kind of a deal breaker completely, but it does make it a little bit harder for us to recognize what these pages are exactly about. So if the multiple products are all related, it's more like variations of the same product, maybe different colors, different sizes. I don't see a problem with that because that's kind of all about this one product,  

#### [0:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3270) |  and these are different variations. And having

one product page rather than one page per variation makes it a little bit easier for us to kind of focus our signals on those pages. On the other hand, if these are completely unrelated products, then it's really hard for us to recognize that this is actually a useful landing page for someone who's looking for that product. So let's say if you have-- I don't know-- shoes, and you have one model of shoes with different colors and sizes.  

#### [0:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3300) |  Having that on one page is fine.

People will search for shoes, and they can go to that page. On the other hand, if you have shoes, and then dresses, and then hats, and you put a variation of these all on one page, then if someone is searching for a pair of shoes, we don't really know if this is the best match for them because it has so much information about hats and dresses as well that it's like, maybe someone searching for a collection of clothing makes sense.  

#### [0:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3330) |  Maybe someone searching for an individual hat,

maybe it doesn't make so much sense. So that's something to keep in mind there. If these are variations, I definitely don't see a problem with that. If these are completely unrelated, then that makes it a lot harder for people to find those pages. If this is a manufacturer's site where end users are not really meant to go to those pages and buy products there directly, maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's enough that distributors  

#### [0:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3360) |  are able to kind of look up--

I need to find a manufacturer who has this specification of products, then that's specific enough to still bring up these pages. So I guess in a typical SEO way, I would say it depends, but it's something where based on your knowledge of that website, of the company, and of their goals, that's something that you can probably make a decision on whether or not this is OK or if this is perhaps suboptimal.  

#### [0:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3390) |  Maybe there's also way to tweak things

a little bit where you say, well, currently, these are unrelated products, but I can tweak it so that the related products come together on one page, then that would probably be a lot better. RAJAT JANGRA: Hello, John. JOHN MUELLER: I still a bit of time, so if any of you want to ask questions, jump in. RAJAT JANGRA: Hi, John.  

#### [0:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3420) |  JOHN MUELLER: Hi. RAJAT JANGRA: John, I

have a question regarding Google's search console. So I was checking this URL. I can show you that URL in chat also. So that URL, particularly when I was checking it into the Google indexing, it was showing me that URL has some crawl-- indexing issues. So this is the URL I have shared you in the chat, so this is the URL. It's showing me URL is not on Google indexing errors.  

#### [0:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3450) |  But the same URL, when I check

into the [INAUDIBLE],, it's showing me URL is available to Google. And it's showing me the availability URL can be indexed. Mobile usability, facts, logos, everything is done on the page. But when I check this into the Google index, it's showing me that the page is-- the different page is not detected because maybe the URL is not interlinked. Maybe that would happen. And the page fetch is also showing an error crawl anomaly,  

#### [0:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3480) |  so I'm just confused which-- I mean,

which one I should follow. I mean, Google's index or live test because right now one is telling me that my page is on Google, but one is telling me I have indexing errors. So what should I do in this situation? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know exactly which errors you're seeing, so it's kind of hard to say what. Just purely from looking at the URL, my worry  

#### [0:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3510) |  is a bit that on this website,

you're generating URLs for a ton of different variations. So it looks like you have car service center, and then you have a location, and then you have a type of car or brand. [INTERPOSING VOICES] JOHN MUELLER: So my worry would be that you have kind of hundreds of thousands or even millions of URLs that are essentially variations.  

#### [0:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3540) |  Like, all the car service centers, and

then you have lawyers, and then you have teachers, and you have all of these different locations, and you're generating URLs for all of them. Then that's something where I could definitely see that our systems might say, well, we're seeing so many URLs from this website, we don't know if it's worthwhile to crawl and index all of them. RAJAT JANGRA: OK. JOHN MUELLER: And that's something where probably the right approach first would be to think about what kind of content  

#### [0:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3570) |  do you really need to have indexed

and also to think about are there perhaps ways to limit the amount of content that is on your website? Are there ways to make sure that all of the content that you're providing is of the highest cost quality possible so that our algorithms, when they run across this URL, they try a little bit harder to actually get it indexed. RAJAT JANGRA: OK, sorry. Yeah. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, so that's kind of the, I think, the first step that I would  

#### [1:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3600) |  take there is to avoid running into

a situation where you have millions of your URLs that are essentially-- I don't know. I could index them, but they're not really fantastic. RAJAT JANGRA: Our team, we are planning to redirect the URLs for the whole website because right now we have one extra [INAUDIBLE] directory in our URL system, so that's why I'm-- well, I have already discussed with my developer team. But I was just-- I mean, this bit I was confused because of maybe this error is  

#### [1:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3630) |  coming because of that pop up also.

Maybe you have seen that pop up once the page is loading. But the problem is this URL in two different categories. So right now this [INAUDIBLE] submitted URL has a crawl issue and [INAUDIBLE] is issuing me. So, I mean, my confusion is just a little bit just like I'm seeing into the Google indexing as well as in the live test. So, yeah, of course, I'll be making the changes to the particular-- all the-- I mean, around the website and changing the city based pages  

#### [1:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3660) |  into one particular car service center and

car service center [INAUDIBLE]. So I'm merging these two categories, so I'm creating only one category, car service center [INAUDIBLE]. So I'll remove the previous category, and then I'll be a URL in this way. But, yeah, I mean, my question was like this. How can I solve this issue of maybe if this is having the crawl issue, so do you think the crawl depth can help me, or, I mean,  

#### [1:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3690) |  or should I take any-- JOHN MUELLER:

So what, I guess, happened here is that we tried to crawl this URL. It didn't work out, and because we have so many URLs otherwise on this website-- I didn't check what the rest of your website looks like. I'm just guessing. But because we have so many other URLs on this website, we don't bother spending a lot of time retrying it. Maybe we'll try it again in a couple of months, but it's not something where we'd say, well,  

#### [1:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3720) |  we really need to get this URL.

We'll retry a few times until the crawl error goes away. So my guess is it kind of ran into that. The other thing to keep in mind is that with mobile first indexing, we would be using a mobile crawler for that. So what we sometimes see is that testing tools, when they check with a desktop crawler, it looks OK, but when they check with a mobile crawler, it doesn't work. So that might be another thing to kind of double check.  

#### [1:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3750) |  Make sure that that's OK. RAJAT JANGRA:

We are currently-- actually, the source is smartphone, so the [INAUDIBLE] showing this source as smartphone for this particular URL. So, I mean, yeah, I have to look into the directory level, but, yeah, I mean, that was-- yeah. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I think it's tricky with really large web sites like this. If you look at individual URLs, then it can often be the case that we say we just have so many URLs from this website.  

#### [1:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3780) |  We look at individual URLs maybe once

a month, maybe once every two or three months, because we just have such a mass of things that you want to have crawled. RAJAT JANGRA: [INAUDIBLE] dynamically so, yeah. JOHN MUELLER: And then errors stick around for a little bit longer because we don't get around to double checking them that quickly. RAJAT JANGRA: Cool. Yeah, thank you, John. Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. OK. NEERAJ KUMAR: John, I have a question too. JOHN MUELLER: All right, let me just switch out the recording so that the YouTube video doesn't get infinitely long.  

#### [1:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmECfzfmdyQ&t=3810) |  I still have a bit of time,

so you're welcome to stick around. But I'll just stop the recording now. Thank you all for joining in, and hope to see some of you again in one of the future hangouts. And if you want to stick around for a little bit longer, feel free to do that as well. All right.
