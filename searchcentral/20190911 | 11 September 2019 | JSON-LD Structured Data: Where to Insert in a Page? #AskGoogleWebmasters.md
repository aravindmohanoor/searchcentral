who's asking is It possible to insert JSON structured data at the bottom of the  instead of the ? It seems to work fine for many websites. Thank you for your question, Virginie. JSON-LD is one of the ways that Google can process structured data on a webpage. The other supported formats are microdata and RDFa. RDFa is an HTML5

attributes added to existing HTML tags on the page. Microdata is an open community HTML specification used to nest structured data within HTML content. Like RDFa it also uses HTML tag attributes for this. JSON-LD in comparison is a JavaScript notation embedded in a script tag in the page head or in the body. The mark-up is not interleaved with user visible text which makes nested data items easier to express.

can be either in the head or the body of the page. So it sounds like we can answer your question with a solid. Yes! JSON-LD can also be injected into your pages using JavaScript if that suits your pages better. Thanks for watching. And remember if you have any questions post them on Twitter using the hashtag #AskGoogleWebmasters. See you next time!
