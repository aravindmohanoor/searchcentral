Jonathan is asking, "Our site is changing servers, and I've had this go disastrously in the past. What do I need to do to ensure that SEO is preserved?" I know. Moves are always stressful. Did you pack everything? Did you turn everything off-- [CLICK] Wait. Don't do that yet. [CLICK] You should wait with turning things off with a server move. Anyway, it's a big event, and it's scary to think that you might have forgotten something.

just moving from one server to another while keeping everything else the same, are pretty uneventful for Google systems. The important part is really that everything else stays the same. The URLs stay the same. The content stays the same. The CMS stays the same. It's all the same website, just hosted on a different IP address. The only common issue that can come up with a server migration like that

it crawls from your website. Our systems do that automatically. The goal is to avoid causing problems on your server through too much crawling. So when we recognize that your server has changed, our systems will generally throttle back, make sure that your new server can cope with the extra work of Googlebot crawling, and then, over time, will increase the speed again to a rate that works well for your server and that helps us to keep your website

mentioned, this is a fully automated process, so you don't need to do anything special here. By the way, we have a fairly comprehensive guide on server migration, should you be curious about some of those extra details. I added a link to that in the description below. And if there are any other questions you have in mind about this, feel free to reach out to the folks in our Webmaster Help Forums, who have seen lots of migrations over the years.
