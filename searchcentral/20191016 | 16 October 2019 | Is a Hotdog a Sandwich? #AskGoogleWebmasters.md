Google Webmasters channel and to today's episode of Ask Google Webmasters. Today, we'll look into a question submitted by Andrew. "This has been on my mind and is definitely not site-specific but is up for much debate in our office. Is a hot dog a sandwich?" I have to say, this is a pretty unique question, and one I've not had to spend too much time on before. Looking around, I found some prior art

To be honest, I don't have a definitive answer. Sorry. Part of the problem here is that hot dogs in Switzerland are quite different than those in the US. So what do you mean, an American or a European hot dog? I'm also quite certain that these vary across countries and regions in Europe, too. So there's that as well. Let's assume for the sake of argument that you're asking about a typical Swiss hot dog, as I

to work. Well, these are essentially half a baguette with a hole in the middle and a sausage stuffed into it. The condiments generally include your choice of either ketchup or mustard dripped into the hole beforehand. On the one hand, a baguette is clearly a kind of bread, which can be used to make a sandwich. On the other hand, it's not cut into slices. In short, a hot dog is obviously not a sandwich.

That said, there are other opinions, and I wouldn't say that they're definitely wrong. For example, while researching this topic with the team, we discovered the so-called cube rule of food, according to which, a local hot dog would be a sushi, or an American dog with the bread sliced open on one side would be considered a taco. Obviously, at this point, I'm getting kind of hungry, so maybe we should just stop recording and take a break.

is that I won't be having a hot dog for lunch, because that's just way too confusing. Anyway, thanks for watching, and catch you next time when we talk about more serious topics, like perhaps canonicalization. [LAUGHTER] SPEAKER 1: Um, uh, cut. [MUSIC PLAYING]
