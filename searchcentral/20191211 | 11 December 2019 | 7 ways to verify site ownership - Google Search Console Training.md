#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=0) |  Hi, I'm Daniel Waisberg,  Search Advocate

at Google. And in this video, I'll talk about how to activate  Search Console for your site so that you can get access  to your Google Search Data. There are seven ways  to verify your site ownership in Search Console, providing you with a wide range of options to choose from. This video should help you find  the method that works best for you. ♪ (music) ♪  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=30) |  Verification is the process of proving to

Google that you own a property. This is needed in order to make sure you are the owner of the website and to prevent others  to see your private search data. Proving ownership on the web, is simply demonstrating the ability to update and make a small  non visible change to your website. If you're the site owner, this should be a very simple operation for you. It could literally take only a few minutes. As the title of the video suggests,  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=60) |  Search Console supports  seven verification methods:

DNS Record, HTML file upload, HTML Tag, Google Analytics tracking code, Google Tag Manager container script, Google Sites, and Blogger. First of all,  for all methods described here, you'll start in the same place. Open your Search Console account and click Add property in the properties list. If you have never verified the property,  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=90) |  the first time  you log into

Search Console, you'll find our special wizard  asking you to verify a property. If it's your first or tenth verification, when you click to add a new property, you'll be asked what property type you want to create. You have two options: Domain property  and URL prefix property. I suggest creating at least one domain property to represent your site, as it is the most comprehensive view of your website information.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=120) |  It will include all URLs in all

subdomains and across HTTP and HTTPS. It requires you to add the DNS record in your domain name provider but it's worth your time. URL prefix property verification is usually a bit simpler as you have multiple verification methods, such as using your existing  Google Analytics or Tag Manager Account. URL prefix properties also make sense if you want to view  a section of your site separately.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=150) |  For example, if you work with a

consultant on a specific part of your site, you might want to verify this part separately so that you can limit access to your data. Now, let's talk about  each of the verification methods available to you. If you're feeling sleepy, now's the time to pause and go get a coffee. ♪ (music) ♪ DNS verification requires you to add the DNS record

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=180) |  in your domain name provider. This is

the only method supported for domain properties. So I'll demonstrate  DNS record verification by creating a domain property. But note that you can also use DNS record verification on URL prefix properties. Add your domain to the domain option  as shown in the screen and click Continue. In the instructions dialog you'll see two options. If your domain registrar  is listed in the instructions drop-down,  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=210) |  you'll be walked through  in an

easier automated process to verify your site. For example,  if your DNS provider is GoDaddy, choose it from the list  and click Start verification. This will lead you to their login page where you'll need  the credentials used in GoDaddy. After logging in, click Authorize and you'll be redirected to Search Console. But don't worry if the verification doesn't work immediately.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=240) |  Just wait a few hours or a

day and try verifying again by choosing it from the Properties list. Sometimes, DNS record changes can be slow. If your Domain Name Provider is not in the list, you'll need to follow  written instructions in the Help Center to copy your DNS Text Record into your domain provider. Start by copying the text record from the dialog after entering your domain. Then, click Full details  to open up the Help Center.  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=270) |  You'll see the full process documented there.

We have instructions  for a lot of domain providers, find yours in the list  and click the link for more information. Now follow the instructions for your specific provider. If you are asked to provide a Google Security Token, that's the token you copied  from Search Console's verification dialog a minute ago. After you change your DNS record, go back to Search Console and click Verify in the verification pane.  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=300) |  If the verification  doesn't work immediately,

wait a few hours or a day and try again as the change may take  some time to take effect. Just choose the unverified property from the Properties drop-down, and it will try  to verify you automatically. To stay verified,  don't remove the DNS Record even after verification succeeds. If you perform the steps above  and your verification does not succeed, check the full details link mentioned previously  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=330) |  to learn about potential errors. You can

find out more about those errors  and how to handle them in the Help Center. In order to verify your website using HTML file upload, you'll need to have permission  to upload the file to your website where it can be accessed by a browser. After you click Add property, add your website URL  under the URL prefix option and click Continue. Expand the HTML file section  where you'll find a file Download button.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=360) |  Download your HTML verification file and upload

it to the Root directory of the property you want to verify. For example, if you want to verify www.example.com, then the root directory is the homepage. If you want to verify  www.example.com/party, then the root directory is /party/. In this case, you would upload the file to /party/,

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=390) |  and all child directories would be verified.

Note that you can use this file in any site you want to verify, it's personalized to your user and can be reused. Once you complete this step,  click Verify in Search Console. If you perform the steps above correctly, verification should work immediately. If it doesn't, click the Full details link to learn about potential errors. You can find out more about those errors  and how to handle them in the Help Center.  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=420) |  In order to verify your website with

an HTML Tag, you'll need permission to edit  the source code of your websites homepage. After you click Add property, add your website URL  under the URL prefix option and click Continue. Expand the HTML Tag Section  to find the meta HTML Tag with a personalized key. Copy the tag and paste it  into your homepage head tag.  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=450) |  Make sure not to change the text.

Verify that the tag is present on your live page by visiting your homepage  and checking the page source text to confirm that the tag is present. Once you complete this step,  click Verify in Search Console. If you perform the steps above correctly, verification should work immediately. If it doesn't, click the Full details link to learn about potential errors. You can find out more about those errors  and how to handle them in the Help Center.  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=480) |  In order to verify your website 

using the Google Analytics tracking code, you'll need an account with Google Analytics that use the same Google account. You must have at least edit permission on the Google Analytics account. If you're not sure  which permission you have, check the Google Analytics Help Center. Before verifying,  ensure that your homepage has the Google Analytics tracking code in the head section of the page.  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=510) |  Although your Analytics tracking code might work

for Analytics  in the body section as well, for Search Console verification it must be in the head section. Open your homepage in a browser, look at the page source code and confirm that the tag is present in the head tag of the page. After you click Add property, add your website URL  under the URL prefix option and click Continue. You must be logged in to Search Console with the same Google account that you use for Google Analytics.  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=540) |  If you perform the steps above correctly,

 verification should work immediately. If it doesn't, click the Full details link to learn about potential errors. You can find out more about those errors  and how to handle them in the Help Center. The Google Analytics tracking code will be used only  to verify site ownership. No Google Analytics data  will be accessed following this process. If you're looking to configure  Search Console data and Analytics,  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=570) |  that's an entirely separate process. Check the

link below to learn more. In order to verify your website with a Google tag manager container snippet, you'll need publish permissions  to your container in Google tag manager. You'll also need to be  logged in to Search Console with the same Google account  that you use for Google tag manager. If you're not sure  which permissions you have, check the Google tag manager  Help Center link below. Before verifying,  ensure that your home page

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=600) |  has the no script portion  of

the tag manager code immediately after the opening body tag. If it does not, verification will fail. Open your home page in a browser, look at the page source code and confirm that the tag is present, and immediately after the body tag with nothing in between. After you click Add property, add your website URL  under the URL prefix option and click Continue. Expand the Google tag manager section where you'll find the button to verify.  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=630) |  If you have the necessary permission, your

verification should work immediately after clicking it. if you perform the steps above correctly, verification should work immediately. If it doesn't, click the Full details link to learn about potential errors. You can find out more about those errors  and how to handle them in the Help Center. The Google tag manager container ID will be used only  to verify site ownership. No Google tag manager data  will be accessed following this process.  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=660) |  In order to verify  your classic

Google site, you must be logged in to Search Console with the same account  used to manage your site. Click Add property, add your website URL  under the URL prefix option, and click Continue. That's it. Your Google site should be verified automatically after this step. If you have a new site  or a site with a custom domain URL, you will not be automatically verified.  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=690) |  If that's the case with your site,

you should use  the Google Analytics method. If you're not sure whether your site is classic or new, check the link below  in the site's Help Center. In order to verify  your website with blogger, you must be logged in to Search Console with the same account  used to manage your blog. After you click Add property, add your website URL  under the URL prefix option and click Continue. That's it, your blog should be verified automatically after this step.  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=720) |  Wow! That was a lot. But before

I leave you, I would like to suggest you  to try and verify your website with more than one verification method just in case one of your existing verification method fails. Verification methods are checked periodically by Google, and if all verification methods for a property fail, your access to that property will expire. But if you lose access to your account, don't worry, we have your back.  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=750) |  You can always reverify with your user

or verify a new owner using one of the methods  described in this video. Every Search Console property  requires at least one verified owner. But I recommend companies  to have more than one owner, as employees may change roles  or leave the organization. So, it's good practice to have several verified owners in Search Console. When it comes to security, account owners will always be able to see the list of all owners and users  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4PmE3LysUM&t=780) |  verified to that site, as well as

the verification methods for each owner. You can then, optionally,  unverify previous owners by removing their verification token. For example, removing  the HTML tag from the site for HTML tag verified owners. Make sure to check your list of owners once in a while, so that you remember  to remove previous employees or agencies you have worked with in the past. That's it. Hopefully, now you have  a better understanding

Console. Now choose your method and get to work. In the next video, I'll discuss the performance reports in Search Console, which you can use to monitor  your site's performance in Google Search.
