have, check the Google Tag Manager Help Center link below. Before verifying, ensure that your home page has the noscript portion of the Tag Manager code immediately after the opening body tag. If it does not, verification will fail. Open your home page in a browser, look at the page source code, and confirm that the tag is present and immediately after the body tag, with nothing in between. After you click Add Property, add your website URL
