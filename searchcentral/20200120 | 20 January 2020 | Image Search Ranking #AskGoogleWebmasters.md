from Sachin Khanna. "Hi, John, please tell us how to rank images on Google? Please tell us some useful tips." Well, images are awesome, for example, images of cheese. Who doesn't like cheese? Anyway, when it comes to images, the number one thing to consider is how you'd want to be found in Image Search. What do you expect users to search for, and how can your site be useful to them when they find you?

because they exist, but rather, do it with a specific goal in mind. Once you have that, you can look at the technical details. Let's start with these. Use high-quality images. Place them on your pages in a relevant and visible way. Use great titles on the pages themselves. Provide useful alt attributes for the images. Potentially add captions.
