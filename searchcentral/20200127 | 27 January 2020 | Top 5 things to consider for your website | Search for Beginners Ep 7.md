on Google search? Here are the five things you should make sure your website does. 1) Does Google know about your website?

website, but maybe you have a brand new site that Google hasn't discovered yet. In that case you can go to Google search console to verify ownership and submit your sitemap. Google will then crawl your website and discover its pages. If your business has a physical location, it's important to make sure your website clearly lists information such as the address and store hours. Make sure to add this information in an easy to find page on your website and if you enhance it with structured data about your business, it will make it really easy for Google to

sometimes take time so one simple way to make way to make these details available on Google is by using 'Google My Business'. 'Google My Business' is a free and easy to use tool that helps you manage how your business information appears across Google including Google Search and Google Maps.

quality content that appears in relevant searches? Are you providing users with the best possible experience? Focus on what makes your website or product unique, valuable, and engaging.

Following that advice will help Google determine the relevancy of your pages. 3) Is your content fast and easy to access on all devices? Most Google searches now occur on mobile so

loads quickly on all devices. Visit g.co/mobilefriendly to test if your pages are mobile-friendly. 4) Modern users expect a safe online experience. Secure your website with an HTTPS connection that keeps your browsing safe by securely connecting your browser or app to the websites you visit. This prevents bad actors from peeping into what is being sent.
