#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=0) |  JOHN MUELLER: All right. Welcome, everyone, to

today's Webmaster Central Office Hour Hangouts. I guess not office hours anymore, but kind of like, I don't know, people hours. My name is John Mueller. I'm a Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google in Switzerland. And part of what we do are these hangouts, where people can join in and ask any question related to their website and web search, and we'll  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=30) |  try to find some answers along the

way. It looks like people are busy with other things, which is totally understandable, and not a ton of questions were submitted. But we have a bunch of people here. So if any of you want to get started with a first question, feel free to jump on in. ANGIE B: John. How are you? JOHN MUELLER: Pretty good.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=60) |  ANGIE B: So I have a question

today about I have a single source amp-carousel on mobile. So it's my page in the results. It has a carousel of amp articles. So we've had it for a while now, for I think almost two years or something. But since around Christmas, the articles stopped updating less frequently. So we stopped getting fresh articles in the carousel. It used to be like, maybe, articles that  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=90) |  were published after two or three hours,

they would appear in the carousel. Now we're lucky to get articles from within the last 24 hours. And there's a lot less content in there now. So we used to have more items, 10 maybe, maybe a little more, around there. And now we have around three, I would say. So since this started happening around Christmas, we've made a few changes to our schema. I noticed there were some inconsistencies  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=120) |  in our timestamp, so on the article

versus on our site maps and our feeds and stuff like that, so we've updated all of that. And I'm not really sure what else it could be. But the carousel itself still hasn't updated, and I don't find too much information online about single source carousels in first place. So I'm not really sure how to diagnose this issue. Do you have any advice for how we might be able to fix it?  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=150) |  JOHN MUELLER: I'm not quite sure what

kind of carousel you mean. Is it the top stories thing on top of the results or? ANGIE B: Actually, if you want to pull it up, if you type Movie News, you'll see. It's like a result for a single page, and it has just a carousel underneath the site link for amped articles. JOHN MUELLER: OK. I probably need to check that afterwards.  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=180) |  It's tricky to check that live. ANGIE

B: [INAUDIBLE] of course. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. If you could mate maybe post some links or a link to a screenshot in the chat here, I can pick that up afterwards and double check. ANGIE B: Sure, no problem. JOHN MUELLER: Usually I'd say the date is definitely something to watch out for. That's something I know a lot of sites get wrong,  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=210) |  and that they have inconsistent time zones,

for example on the page and in the structure data. But otherwise, my hunch is that for a lot of these cases where there's just less content showing up in the search results, it's more a matter of quality and that our algorithms are not quite sure about the quality of this content, and therefore they're kind of reducing the visibility  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=240) |  of that content appropriately. ANGIE B: I

tried to send the screenshot, and it accidentally changed the page. So I just missed what you were saying. I'm sorry. Can you repeat it? JOHN MUELLER: Sure. Sure. So I think dates is probably a good point to look at. That's something that a lot of sites get wrong, especially if there is an inconsistency with time zone, for example. So that's definitely a good thing. But otherwise, for a lot of these cases where  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=270) |  the site or its content is just

not as visible in the search results, it's really more a matter of the quality of the content, where our algorithms are a bit unsure, maybe, how much of this content we should be showing. So that's something where on the one hand, double checking all of the technical issues is definitely a good idea. But I wouldn't only limit your review of the site to technical issues, but really kind of be critical about the quality of the content as well.  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=300) |  And I haven't looked at your site.

I don't know exactly what kind of content you have there. So I'm just kind of throwing this out there. But if you can post some links in the chat, then I can take a look at that afterwards. ANGIE B: The other thing that might like thicken the mystery a little bit is we do perform very well in Top Stories carousels in general. And we have other carousels for some other pages in the search  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=330) |  results. So some other queries that we

rank for, those carousels seem to update more frequently. And if you even Google just the brand name of our site and you know there's carousel for latest articles, those always are very recent and plentiful, I guess. So it just seems to be for that query in particular. And it was a bit of a recent change, only a few months ago. So does that shine some more light to the situation?  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=360) |  JOHN MUELLER: It's hard to say. I

mean, to me, that would sound like from a technical point of view, you're probably doing it right. And it's really a matter of us trying to understand which pieces of content from your site we should be showing. So especially if you're seeing it in the Top Stories or you're seeing it for other kinds of carousels, then it means we're technically able to crawl and index the content fast enough. So it's probably, from a technical point of view,  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=390) |  not an issue, and really more a

matter of we don't know how much of your content to show for those particular queries, especially if you're saying for some queries it works well and for others it doesn't. ANGIE B: OK. So maybe more of a relevancy thing here? JOHN MUELLER: Could be, yeah. ANGIE B: OK. Because we did change our content operation slightly around that time to expand it to doing newer verticals, I would say, newer genres of content that we didn't do before, whereas the movie news content,  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=420) |  that was our primary content before. So

could that potentially affect it? JOHN MUELLER: I think it's tricky when it comes to things like that because when things change, it's often not based on the things that you change on your website just the moments before. So from a technical point of view, you do have this relationship very quickly  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=450) |  where if you make a big technical

change, that'll take a couple of days. And so be visible in search, but from a quality point of view, usually the quality changes take a lot longer to be updated in search. So if you're seeing significant changes in search, and you just made some changes a couple of days ago, then those changes-- unless there was a technical issue with those changes-- then that probably wouldn't be related. So if you're saying you changed the way that you created the content maybe a week before this change in search,  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=480) |  then my feeling is that wouldn't be

related to kind of this drop in visibility that you're seeing. ANGIE B: OK, I'll send over a screenshot in the chat so you can take a look. Thank you. And then if you have time, I had a second quick question. JOHN MUELLER: OK. Go for it. ANGIE B: So I work on publishing websites that get a lot of Google Discover traffic. And I know you said in the past that you guys currently  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=510) |  don't have plans to add a referral

source for Google Discover in particular. So recently we had a situation where an ad partner that we were trying to work with audited one of our websites that gets a particularly high amount of Discover traffic. And they assumed it was suspicious activity on the website because there was no keywords. The keyword data didn't match up with the amount of Google  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=540) |  traffic that we were getting. So in

this case, we have a pretty good relationship with that advertiser, so they contacted us, and we were able to explain the situation and stuff. But I don't know if this is something that you've heard affects other publishers. Given that that's the case that these situations arise from there not being a proper referral for Google Discover, is it something you guys would consider adding in the future?  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=570) |  JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. I'd like

to have a clearer refer for Discover. But at the same time, from a bigger picture point of view, we see Discover as a part of search, as part of this big Google family of ways to get traffic for a website. So other people are saying, well, we should just fold it all together into one big refer and keep it like that. So I totally get the advertising angle.  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=600) |  That's probably tricky. The one place where

we do have Discover data is in Search Console, where you see the total amount of clicks and impressions that you got, the click-through rate there. So that's something where you could point at, that or you could exploit that as a kind of a CSV file and show that to them, too, to show a little bit how the split is between normal search traffic and Discover traffic.  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=630) |  ANGIE B: For sure. And on that

note, we do have the Search Console data. But in GA, it can be hard to map, I would say, the two sources to each other. For us, our Google Discover traffic ends up kind of the dark direct traffic. So it gets lumped in there, and then it becomes difficult to sort of untangle it. And the numbers for sessions and clicks never really quite match up. So it just becomes a little muddled.  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=660) |  So even internally, I find that there

are issues with sort of disambiguating that Google Discover data because given that I think Chrome article suggestions are properly distinguished as Google API's as the source. So it is a bit of a confusing situation from all aspects. And if there is any way to maybe pass this feedback on to the dev team or something, I would really appreciate that.  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=690) |  JOHN MUELLER: I'll push for that again.

I think lots of people want more data with regards to Discover, especially when they see a lot of traffic going through there. So I totally understand your point. ANGIE B: Thank you very much. JOHN MUELLER: All right. Any other questions before we get started with the submitted ones? DARCY BURK: Yeah, sure, John. I've got a question about FAQ schema or QA page schema.  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=720) |  We write a lot of content and

a lot of articles where the main topic is a single question, but there are often multiple answers. So I'm just wondering about how to mark that up because the way that I've marked it up, it doesn't really look good when I get the schema generated. The question just shows up multiple times. I have the title of the question multiple times, and each with a different answer. I'm assuming that that's probably not super good to do.  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=750) |  What would you suggest I do instead

of listing the question five times with the five different answers? What might I do differently? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. Hard to say. I think QA page is also more meant for user generated content, right? DARCY BURK: Yeah. So then it's FAQ, the other one. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I'm always confused with those two. DARCY BURK: Yeah, me too.  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=780) |  JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. I would

test things out. I think the nice part about this is that you can see fairly quickly if it gets picked up and shown, and that makes it a little bit easier for you to double check things like the clicks and impressions, click-through rate. If you're getting what you think you'd like to achieve with those pages, then I think that's a good idea. I don't know with regards to the policies  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=810) |  if something like this it is OK

to kind of say, well, it's the same question but they're multiple answers, so therefore I have multiple entries in the FAQ. DARCY BURK: That's what I'm mostly worried about, is if I might [INAUDIBLE] some sort of a policy. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I am not aware of anything particular with regard to the policy in that regard. And usually what would happen, if there were something where this would go against the policy, what would happen is someone from the website team  

#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=840) |  would take a look at that and

say, oh, this is not compliant. They'd apply a manual action for that, which would essentially mean that the structured data, the rich results would not be shown that way in search until the reconsideration process has been completed. So it's not that your website would drop in ranking. It wouldn't disappear from the index or anything. It's really just those elements where the team says, it's not compliant usage. Those would not be shown. So it's something where, especially  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=870) |  if the guidelines aren't completely clear, then

that feels like something where you can try things out a little bit, see what works well for you. And if someone from the website team would look at that and say, well, this really doesn't match our guidelines, or we've changed our guidelines because we see people do things in weird ways, and that suddenly includes things that you're doing, then in the worst case, you'd be going through that reconsideration process, which

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=900) |  it does take a bit of time,

but it's not the end of the world. DARCY BURK: And might that only affect that page, or am I putting my site at risk? JOHN MUELLER: That would generally affect the site and that type of rich result. DARCY BURK: Got it. OK. I'm going to try doing question, and I'm going to append maybe part of the first answer so it doesn't look-- because it just looks really spammy. It's question, question, question showing up in the FAQ schema.  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=930) |  I'm going to try something a little

different. But thanks for your help. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. BARRY SCHWARTZ: John, on the FAQ schema, they used to show emojis. Do you know if Google recently stopped showing emojis in FAQ schema, or are you not aware of anything with that? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. So we're not showing them anymore? BARRY SCHWARTZ: Somebody said they're not. I tried to search for them for a long, long time. And then I found one French site that happened to show it, but I don't have a query. I have old screenshots and those don't even show FAQ schema at all.  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=960) |  So you're not aware of any change

there. JOHN MUELLER: I'm not aware of anything particular with the FAQ and emojis. I know with emojis, one of the things that they always struggle with is kind of misleading emojis. So if people have stars, for example, and they make it look like review stars, then that's something where the snippets team might look at that and say, well, we should filter out these particular characters because they're  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=990) |  misleading to people. But that's less a

matter of the FAQ markup or not, but more it's like, well, we've noticed that this is really being spammed, and people are using them for misleading ways. Then that might be something where we take action. But otherwise, we have lots of weird characters in the search results and try to allow people to be a little bit creative. DARCY BURK: Barry, I'll throw a question mark emoji in one of my FAQ schemas and see  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1020) |  if that shows up for you. JOHN

MUELLER: Cool. OK. Let me get through some of the submitted questions, and then we can get back to more questions from you all. Hang tight. If Google has moved my site to mobile first indexing, do I have to optimize or at least put more effort into my AMP pages? So from my point of view, this doesn't change anything with regards to how much effort you  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1050) |  should put into the AMP pages. The

AMP pages should be consistently matching what users would see anyway. So that's something where the mobile first indexing site is kind of independent of how much work you should be putting into your AMP pages. In general, the AMP team, for example, is not fond of pages that are very simplified AMP pages where there's a lot of content missing. Obviously there are some elements that you can't easily do on AMP pages, and that's fine.  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1080) |  But in general, the AMP page should

match as much as possible what you have on your normal pages. My site is no longer appearing in search results. There are no violations on my site, and it's stopped appearing completely from March 12. It's a Google News approved site. I received over 3,000 bad backlinks from my competitors and over fake DMCA complaints from my competitors, which I've countered them and awaiting Google's response.  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1110) |  Why is my site de-indexed, demoted in

Google when there is no violation of my site? It's really hard to say without a site. So that's something where what I would usually recommend in a case like this is to post this in the Webmaster Help Forum, where there are a bunch of people that are able to take a look at your site and give you some guidance on what you could be looking at there. And they're also able to escalate issues that they're not able to resolve in the Webmaster Forum.  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1140) |  So that's something where it's kind of

like a normal escalation path there. They can also help you to figure out what kind of issues you're really looking at there because on the one hand, you're saying your site is no longer appearing, and then the last question is like, why is my site the de-indexed or demoted in search? And from our point of view, there's a really big difference between a site that's de-indexed and a site that is demoted? So de-indexed would be not appearing at all.  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1170) |  It's not indexed at all, which oftentimes

is either due to a very significant web spam issue or a technical issue. And so if it's really de-indexed, that's something where oftentimes there are really clear paths to resolving that, whereas if it's demoted, where it's just not ranking as well as before, then that's a lot trickier because that can be due to a lot of different reasons  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1200) |  with regards to the quality of the

content, the general setup of the site. All of that can play a role there. In general, I wouldn't worry too much about these 3,000 bad backlinks from competitors. Our systems are pretty good at recognizing those kind of things and ignoring them. So that's something I wouldn't focus on too much. With regards to DMCA complaints, obviously responding to them if they're invalid is the right approach there to do.  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1230) |  There seems to have been a very

significant change that took place on January 14. My traffic and revenue have been negatively affected despite no penalty or notification of any problems. While I'm used to ebb and flow of traffic and revenue, I guess it goes on. Are you able to give any advice on specific things to focus on to get back on track? So first of all, I'm not aware of anything specific  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1260) |  that happened on January 14. So I

don't really know exactly what you're pointing out there. I also don't know your site so it's really hard to say what might be involved there. In general, I think there are a few things to keep in mind. On the one hand, there are lots of sites in the search results. So it's never the case that everyone is demoted and no longer visible in search because there are always sites that come up as well.  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1290) |  It's not that we don't show anything

in search. So these kind of changes are generally pretty normal, and they can come and go. And that can be due to changes in our algorithms. It can be due to changes in the way that people search. So if a topic suddenly is no longer as interesting, then maybe you will have less traffic for those kind of queries just because it's something that people don't search for anymore. It can also be due to changes in quality  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1320) |  on the website or the perceived quality

of a website based on our algorithms. But all of these things are really kind of hard to guess at without knowing your website. So that's something where I'd also start a thread in the Webmaster Help Forum to get other people's input on this. And when you start a thread there, try to be as transparent as possible about your site, the kinds of queries that you're seeing changes in, maybe significant changes that you've made  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1350) |  on your website in the past, so

that people are really able to look at this problem and give you honest and direct advice. There's no need to hide things that you're aware of but you don't really want people to notice offhand. It's a lot easier for people to help if they have a clearer picture of what's involved with your site. What are the major differences between any two posts that rank at number n and at number n plus 1 in the search results?  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1380) |  That's really hard to say. It's not

we have this one factor that determines the ranking of pages in the search results. It's really more that we have lots and lots of different factors that are involved. And sometimes there are subtle differences between pages and the way our algorithms review them. And they can result in one page being ranked higher at one moment, and then maybe when we review them again,  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1410) |  our algorithms, we maybe rank them in

the other order. And it's not the case that there is this one magic thing where everything is sorted by this number. I don't think that would really make sense. So there is no kind of like one search ranking factor that trumps everything else. How to hide text in an SEO friendly way.  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1440) |  For example, we have a big table

of contents in an article, and we want to hide part of it for mobile users. So I think, in general, this kind of question is tricky because on the one hand, you're saying this content is important. Otherwise you wouldn't have it on your pages. On the other hand, you're saying, well, you want to hide it from your users. So you're saying it's not that important. My general recommendation here would be to make up your mind  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1470) |  and to pick either leaving the content

on there and making it available to everyone, including users and search engines, or removing that content from your pages so that it's not on the page anymore. In particular, when it comes to mobile users, at least from the numbers that we see, most users are using mobile devices nowadays. So if you're trying to hide content from most users, then that seems to me a pretty strong signal that you probably  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1500) |  don't need this content at all. If

you do want to keep that content and you just really think mobile users don't need this, then I would just put it on a separate URL so that those who do want to see the content, they can navigate through that URL, they can click a link to go there. And those that don't want to see that content have the page without that content. I'm working on an international site revamp and migration project which takes the phrase approach for launching  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1530) |  different market sites. There will be a

transitional period with different new and legacy market sites concurrently running with different URL structure on the same domain. The issue is this situation will make implementation of hreflang very difficult as each market site has around 1,000 pages. Every time a new site is launched, update of hreflang tags has to go through thousands of pages. For this transitional period, would it  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1560) |  be OK to just have geosignals with

location targeting setting and search console and subfolder structure differentiating countries without implementing hreflang tags until all new sites are launched? From my point of view that sounds like a reasonable strategy. In general, when it comes to hreflang, especially with large international sites, the one thing I would watch out for is that every time you add a new connection within your matrix of hreflang pages, that  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1590) |  expands and adds a lot more complexity

all the time. So if there is a way, for example, for you to go from having all of these different versions and go to having fewer versions, maybe just country-based versions, then I'd try to go in that direction. Usually fewer pages makes everything a lot easier,  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1620) |  especially if you have pages that can

be either just purely geotargeted where you don't need hreflang, then that makes it a lot easier as well. One way you can think about this is if you're already in this transitional period where you remove the hreflang data, then you can track the usage of your site in Search Console or in analytics, for example, and see if people are actually hitting the right version of your site because it might be, for example, that you only  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1650) |  need to use hreflang on a limited

number of pages rather than all pages. What I often see is that, especially when you're using hreflang just to differentiate between different language versions, then that's something where, maybe, for the brand name, it will be hard for us to recognize which language version to show for queries. But especially when people are searching for long tail content, specific pages within your website,  

#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1680) |  they'll be searching in ways that is

easily recognizable to be in one particular language. And if we understand a user's language, and we understand you have pages in this language, then we can just map them. We don't need hreflang to match that better. But for example, for home pages or maybe for category pages, that's something where sometimes hreflang helps us to figure out a little bit better what people mean when they're just searching for a brand name.  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1710) |  I was working with a website person

who made himself an admin in Search Console, and we're no longer working together or speaking. But now I can't delete him from the console. It's him and I that are both admins. So I guess that's always an awkward situation, especially if you're no longer speaking. But in general, in Search Console,  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1740) |  there are two main ways that you

can add people as owners in Search Console. On the one hand, you can do that by adding a token for verification. And that makes them the owner, essentially, of that site as well. Or you can also use delegation features in Search Console, which means essentially you have the site verified, and you're just telling Search Console, by the way, this other person also has access.  

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1770) |  Depending on how you set that up,

that determines how you can revoke that access. If it's done through delegation, you can just remove that in Search Console, and that'll essentially be picked up, and then that user will no longer have access to your site in Search Console. On the other hand, if that access was created through a token on your site, so maybe a meta tag or a verification file or DNS entry or whatever, then you need to remove that token  

#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1800) |  from your website first because otherwise, Search

Console will just be helpful and reverify that owner if you were to remove them from Search Console. One way to figure out how that user is verified is to go through Search Console into the Settings section. There is a section, I think, for Users and Permissions. And there you should see a list of the users that you have there. And next to the user name there is a,  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gxrjCw3VRjY/maxres2.jpg)



#### [0:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1830) |  I think, dot dot dot menu that

you can click on to manage the verified users. And that takes you to yet another page where you see the different verification methods that were used for that site. So that's where you can see which user has which type of verification access. And if there is a file involved, I think it shows you the file name. And if there's a meta tag, it gives you the ID that's shown in the meta tag. And with that, you can go and remove that information  

#### [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1860) |  from your server, that token. And then

you can unverified that user in Search Console in that place. So that's a little bit more involved. That's something where you kind of have to dig through a little bit to find that. But essentially, those are the two main ways that you can remove someone from access in Search Console. Usually my recommendation is to use delegation as much as possible because that makes it a lot easier for you  

#### [0:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1890) |  to add people. You don't need to

change anything on the server, and also makes it easier for you to remove access once people move on. We have many products that don't vary much in the details, but these are genuinely different products and therefore have their own URLs. One of my considerations is that Google may perceive this as a lot of thin content. While this was still the case before our domain move, and our rankings we previously had were good,  

#### [0:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1920) |  my thoughts are that the loss of

authority that occurred during the domain move, and still seems to exist, meant that Google no longer overlooks these issues and treats us in a way similar to that of a new domain. In effect, it's possibly seeing this as spammy, therefore negatively impacting the whole domains listings. Is this likely to be a problem? If so, how can I solve it? Should I, for example, noindex the product pages,  

#### [0:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1950) |  use rel canonical on product pages to

their respective categories, or something else? So I think I've seen your site a few times. I took a look at your site with some folks, I don't know, a couple of weeks back when I think you were in one of the Hangouts. And from our point of view, we don't really see anything holding the site back. So it's not the case that there's anything problematic with the site  

#### [0:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=1980) |  per se in the sense that you'd

have to do something different than any other website. From our point of view, we're trying to rank this content the way that we would try to rank it on any other website. So it's not something specifically tied to the domain move or the changes that you had there. I think a lot of those fluctuations that you had there with that domain move, which, from what I recall, weren't that great in the sense  

#### [0:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2010) |  that the redirects were kind of weird.

And I believe there's some JavaScript issues or something initially. I think from our side, all of those details are essentially resolved, and it's really just a matter of us trying to figure out how to rank your content appropriately. And there is nothing different that you would have to do than any other website. So from that point of view, I would treat this  

#### [0:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2040) |  as any kind of situation where you're

creating a website and you have different products. And if you think these are unique products that people would be searching for separately, then keep them separately. That's something where if someone is looking for something that really matches what you're providing, then that feels like a good idea to have a landing page for that, and to have that product be visible in search. On the other hand, if there are ways for you to reduce the number of pages so that you can focus on fewer pages that are stronger,  

#### [0:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2070) |  then I think that's also a good

idea. So that's something where you kind of have to balance those two sides. On the one hand, having pages that are really well-targeted for individual queries. On the other hand, having pages that are really strong. And sometimes with a website, that can evolve over time, where you say, well, initially maybe you have fewer pages that are indexed, and you try to make them as strong as possible, and you try to build out your offering so that search engines  

#### [0:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2100) |  and users understand which parts of your

site are really important, and it helps you to focus on those pieces of content as well so that you can kind of create more pieces of content in that style, all of that. But that's not something where there's kind a yes or no, like you always have to do it like this or always have to do it like that. You kind of have to find that balance yourself. One thing that's kind of useful about this situation is you can also test this, where if you take  

#### [0:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2130) |  a part of your website and say,

well, I'm not really sure if we should reduce the number of pages that we have indexed or expand them, you can take a part of your website and have a more limited set there. And you can have the other part of your website with a more expanded set there. And if the overall numbers are fairly comparable otherwise, then you can pretty much see if, by making one of those changes, you're increasing the visibility of your content overall, getting better targeted users, or if you're going in the opposite direction.  

#### [0:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2160) |  And with that, you can kind of

try to refine things a little bit. Is it OK to expand from narrow niche to a broad niche? To me it's normal. But in different examples, I found bad results by Google when doing it. Is it because Google doesn't understand the expansion or different approach by the webmaster or an EAT issue. So you can definitely go from a narrow niche to a broad niche.  

#### [0:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2190) |  You can go from a broad niche

to a narrow niche. You can expand your site or reduce it or focus on more specific areas. All of these are completely natural and normal changes within a website and they happen with any business, where you kind of evolve and change the products and the services that you provide to match what users are currently looking for. And it's never the case that you figure out what users are looking for and you can keep doing that forever.  

#### [0:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2220) |  You kind of have to continue to

evolve this over time. And usually, what people do is kind of A/B testing to figure out which of these variations works best, sometimes expanding things, sometimes folding things together. So that's something where there's really nothing special from Google's side that says you can't create more pages of this type, or you can't fold multiple pages together into one page. That's totally up to you, essentially.  

#### [0:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2250) |  My question isn't related to page rank.

I'm asking about URL discovery, site architecture. We always keep our category pages as no index follow. Is Google seeing our product URLs in those categories, or are they completely 404 in Google's eyes? So that's kind of hard to say without knowing your site. So if the product pages do exist,  

#### [0:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2280) |  then we definitely don't see them as

404s. If these are category pages and you're blocking them from indexing, then we wouldn't be able to index those. And over time, we would have trouble finding the links that you have on those pages. So that's something where if those products are only linked from pages that are within the set of pages that are no index, then that's probably going to be hard for us to understand that those products are actually useful and important for your site.  

#### [0:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2310) |  Your products can be linked a variety

of different ways, though. So they could be in multiple categories. So maybe in one category page, they're linked, and another one, they're not linked. That's also fine. It could be that your products are cross-linked between each other so that you have something like related products that you're linking together. That's also generally fine. They could be linked from your home page as well. If you have your best sellers, and that's something, we'd be able to find those products fairly well, too.  

#### [0:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2340) |  All of these are different ways to

discover these URLs on your website. From our point of view, we currently don't have any exact guidelines on how to deal with category pages. I think what we're probably going to evolve towards is to say that for category pages in particular, you should allow one set to be indexed. So you pick one sorting order, for example, and let that order, that set of category pages,  

#### [0:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2370) |  be completely indexed. And all of the

alternate variations of that, with different filters or different sorting orders, you'd probably want to set to no index. So that would allow us to go through one set of category pages and really find all products that you have linked there, and essentially go off and index your product pages directly. And if there are things in specific versions of category pages that you find critical, where maybe a specific filter's set or a specific sorting order is very critical,  

#### [0:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2400) |  then maybe let that first page of

that variation be indexed as well. But that's kind of the direction where we'd be headed. I think in general, just always setting all category pages to no index and follow is probably not a great strategy. And that's one where I would recommend at least using some kind of a local crawler tool to double check that we can actually find all of your category pages because if we can't reach them  

#### [0:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2430) |  with normal crawling, then it's kind of

hit and miss if we'd be able to show them well in search anyway. The Google News algorithm is not working as the old style because my news trends on Google. Don't really understand that question. I think in general with Google News, we've made a number of changes. And that's something where things will continue to evolve.  

#### [0:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2460) |  So I don't think there are any

plans to say, oh, all of these changes that we've worked on for such a long time, we need to drop them all. That's something where if you have specific feedback on specific kinds of queries or specific results in Google News, that would be really useful to have. And I think in Google News, you can also submit feedback directly. So that's kind of the direction I would head there.  

#### [0:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2490) |  If this is specific to your site

as a news publisher, I would go to the Google News Publisher Forum and chat with other publishers there. OK. I think we kind of made it through the submitted questions, so I'll just open it up to more questions from you all if there's anything on your side. DIDO GRIGOROV: OK, John. I have one quick question. I have noticed in the Google Webmaster Forums,  

#### [0:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2520) |  and we have experienced it with some

of our projects, sometimes we see that, for example, for a very quick time, the homepage of a specific website just go away from the index, and we don't see it in the results with the site comment. It's probably the same for the Google Search Console, but once we remix it with the indexation request, it appears back again. Could you explain, please, why this happens? And I know that the reason could be very different.  

#### [0:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2550) |  But the most common reasons you have

observed. JOHN MUELLER: I'd love to see some examples like that if you see that because then I can double check to see what is actually happening internally. Usually this kind of fluctuation, especially with things like home pages, shouldn't be happening. What might happen is, if you do a site query, that the home page is just not the first result. That's completely normal. From our point of view, a site query is an artificial query.  

#### [0:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2580) |  So there is no predetermined order where

we'd say, this is the order we should always give the results in. So just because the home page isn't the first one in the site query results, from my point of view, wouldn't be a sign of any problem. If the home page were not index at all, that seems a little bit different. That seems like something where it would be useful to look at examples. DIDO GRIGOROV: OK. Maybe I can send you something.  

#### [0:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2610) |  OK. Thank you. DARCY BURK: OK, I

have another question, John, if nobody else has one. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. Go for it. DARCY BURK: I think-- confirm something first, hopefully. I think you guys have always said when it comes to the speed of a site, you're really only-- like directly, from a ranking standpoint-- directly impacting  

#### [0:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2640) |  the slowest of slow sites. Is that

just an SEO thing that we say, or is that actually true? And then I have a follow-up to that. JOHN MUELLER: I think for the most part, that's still the case. So that was essentially the-- when we initially launched all of the speed as the ranking factor things a number of years ago, that was definitely the case, where we tried to differentiate between normal speed sites and really slow sites. I could imagine that over time, especially with mobile sites,  

#### [0:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2670) |  we might find a more granular approach.

But it's really still the case that if you're tweaking milliseconds, then that's probably not the best use of your time if you're only worried about SEO. DARCY BURK: Yeah. Just from an SEO perspective. OK, because you and Martin did a video. And the very first question, I think, was about speed. And then Martin said something like-- I don't remember his exact words-- but something like,  

#### [0:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2700) |  we only look at the really slow

sites and the really fast sites. So he did include that other end of the spectrum. So I don't know if that was just him saying that you look at those things, or if you actually boost sites that are on the 95th percentile or whatever it may be. JOHN MUELLER: I think it probably all comes to the same thing. So if we reduce slow sites, then essential  

#### [0:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2730) |  we're boosting faster sites. There's no real

difference between saying one set of sites is ranking higher and another set of sites is ranking lower. It's like you can't do one without the other. So that's always kind of that two-sided thing. DARCY BURK: OK. So maybe all things-- I don't know, you can never say all things being equal. But a site that was middle of the pack and then a site that was 95th percentile fast, the one that was faster  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gxrjCw3VRjY/maxres3.jpg)



#### [0:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2760) |  might rank above for that reason? JOHN

MUELLER: It's possible. I think if you're talking about sites that are reasonably fast, then probably wouldn't see a big difference there. But if it's something where there's really a noticeable difference between those two, then I would expect there to be some differences. The tricky part, I think, with speed is that there are so many different ways  

#### [0:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2790) |  of measuring speed. And there's kind of

the theoretical approach, where you just run a series of tests. And then there is the field data, where we look at what people are actually seeing. And all of these things are kind of mixed together, and they always bring kind of a blurry number. So usually, if you're just tweaking milliseconds, then you're kind of still within this range of blurriness where you're not really seeing any big changes. DARCY BURK: Gotcha. Thank you very much. JOHN MUELLER: Sure.  

#### [0:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2820) |  Let's see. I think there's some stuff

in the chat. Is there an alternative to crawl this URL and its direct links in the new Search Console. No, not that I'm aware of. It's really, essentially, inspect URL and then submit that URL for indexing. There's no mechanism to say submit all URLs that are linked from here to indexing. What usually I'd recommend doing here  

#### [0:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2850) |  is just using sitemap files to do

all of this in a more programmatic way rather than to manually go through and submit things. Let's see. Google is planning to eliminate third party cookies entirely in Chrome browser by 2022 for the sake of more private web. What actions should be taken about it in general?  

#### [0:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2880) |  Well, I think if they're removed in

Chrome, then probably you want to make sure that your sites don't break because of that. I'd say the primary effect thing that I would watch out for is that your site still works well for users. When it comes to SEO, this is usually less of an issue. However, we do use Chrome to render pages for indexing. So if your site is significantly different with regards  

#### [0:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2910) |  to cookies, then that's something where, from

an indexing point of view, if after rendering, we can't get all of your content, then we'll index the content that we do have. So that's something where if you're somehow reliant on these third party cookies to create a page that contains all of the content for your site, then that's something where you need to watch out for. The other thing, I guess, with regards to cookies  

#### [0:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2940) |  is Google bot does doesn't keep cookies.

So if you give cookies to Google bot, then those cookies might be used for that one time rendering, but they won't be used for the next crawl or the next run when Google reprocesses your pages again. So sometimes people trip over that in that they expect that Google bot keeps reusing the cookies that it has. And we essentially try to crawl and render pages with a completely fresh slate.  

#### [0:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=2970) |  Let's see. Any German e-commerce? My domains

are declining in coronavirus season. OK. I don't know what I can say there. I imagine that depends a lot on the type of your site. I don't know how it is in Germany at the moment. Here in Switzerland, we essentially closed all stores yesterday, except for grocery stores  

#### [0:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3000) |  and maybe pharmacies, I think. So if

people want products, they end up going online. So I would imagine that a lot of these things will be picking up and more people going online to buy stuff because they can't go and buy things in person. That said, this is kind of a unique situation, and who knows how it will develop? So I'm not going to make any kind of prognosis  

#### [0:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3030) |  on how that happens. What are all

the places Discover content can appear? We're aware of Chrome article suggestions and Discover feed and the Google app. Are there other sources Discover content can be seen by users? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know of all of the sources. I think there are three main sources. But apart from the two that you mentioned, I can't think of the third one.  

#### [0:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3060) |  I think it's kind of been the

Chrome new tab, the Discover feed, and then something else. But I can't think of it at the moment. I believe we have a Help Center article that has this a little bit more in detail. We're a new site and we lost all of our traffic over years because we appear from Top Stories and Discover. What can we do before we close?  

#### [0:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3090) |  I don't know. That's, I think, a

tough situation to be in all the time, yeah. With regards to both Top Stories and Discover, these are algorithmic features. So we will use a number of factors to determine when we would show sites or when we wouldn't. And these kind of algorithmic changes can change over time. So it's really hard to say what exactly you should be doing there. It's definitely not the case that there  

#### [0:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3120) |  is one meta tag that will automatically

make your site appear or disappear in these sections. The thing I would generally try to focus on is quality. I think I've seen your site before, and it seems like a pretty reasonable site. But it's still something where our algorithms focus a lot on quality, and especially for elements like Top Stories, where we try to show sites that have recent content for specific topics,  

#### [0:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3150) |  or Discover, where we're trying to highlight

content that matches what we think users might be interested in at the moment. That's something where quality is very important for us. I think Discover is a bit unique because it's something where there's no query associated with it. So it's really kind of tricky for us to find the right results that we can show there.  

#### [0:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3180) |  All right. Any more questions from any

of you? nothing at the moment. OK. That's good, too. SERGIO QUINONEZ: John? JOHN MUELLER: Hi. SERGIO QUINONEZ: Hi. Yeah, I have this very strange situation with a client of mine. They've had a website for, I believe, more or less five years. And then, I would say, within the last 12 months,  

#### [0:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3210) |  we've lost approximately 80% to 85% of

the organic traffic, which is very strange. We rebuilt the site a year ago, and then the first three months everything was going great, getting, actually, even more traffic. And the rankings were going up. And then at some point, everything started to decline to the point, like I said, we've lost approximately 80% of the traffic.  

#### [0:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3240) |  The technical side of the site, everything

seems to be working fine. We don't find any errors. We've maintained the same backlinks. The speed of the website seems to be OK. We don't see any slow pages. It's mobile friendly. But there's nothing that we can see that's not working. So we don't really know. There's only one thing.  

#### [0:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3270) |  There was another website, I believe another

version of the website, who someone accidentally uploaded, and it got indexed on a different domain with the exact same content. And that seems to be at the same time when we saw the ranking drops. And so what they did was they removed everything. They took everything down from that domain. But we never recovered the rankings, so I'm not really sure what to do. JOHN MUELLER: OK.  

#### [0:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3300) |  So usually what would happen, if we

see the same content being hosted again on a website, is we would try to canonicalize that content, which essentially means our systems would say, well, we have multiple URLs for this piece of content. Which one is the right one to show? And usually we'd be able to keep the existing URLs and say, well, this is where it's always been  

#### [0:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3330) |  and this is what we're going to

show in search. It can happen that we switch to another domain. That can, for example, happen if you do a domain move, and for whatever reason you can't set up redirects. And we'll try to figure that out and switch those URLs over. However, the switching of the URLs for canonicalization is purely a technical matter on our side. It's something where we're essentially just changing the URL that we would show in the search result. So if it's the same content, we switched the URLs.  

#### [0:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3360) |  It would rank exactly the same way

as before, just with a different URL. If you switch the URLs back, if we see that things should go back to the previous URL, then that's just like a technical change of those URLs. We'll switch back over to the other version. And that's not something that would have lingering effect. It's really just, well, this URL is the right one. Oh, wait, no, the other one is the right one. And from that point of view, that kind of copy  

#### [0:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3390) |  of the site that you accidentally had

live, I don't see that as having any lingering effects there. If you're worried about that, if that's something that just recently happened, the one thing I would try to do is make it so that the canonicalization is as obvious as possible. So set up redirects from the old domain to the new one so that we can really tell if we were to crawl those old URLs where you had a copy, then you clearly tell us, actually, this  

#### [0:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3420) |  is the one that should be used

by Google. If you just delete the old version, then that's a bit trickier. SERGIO QUINONEZ: That's the thing. The thing is-- sorry to interrupt-- the thing is the other website is live. But it's a completely different domain. It's actually a subsidiary company. And by mistake, they just copied the exact same content. It went live. It got indexed. And then when they noticed that it was problematic, then they took it down.  

#### [0:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3450) |  And so I'm not sure if that

might be the reason. And so if that's still being canonicalized to something that doesn't exist, I don't know if that's the root cause of the issue. ANGIE B: Yeah. I think one way you can double-check that is to take your existing website, the original version, and use Inspect URL tool in Search Console to see what we pick as canonical for some of those URLs. And you should see there either we  

#### [0:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3480) |  don't have this page indexed, or we've

picked your version as a canonical, or we picked the other version as a canonical. And if you're seeing that we picked your version as a canonical, then essentially that's resolved, that technical back and forth thing is resolved. And my hunch is that this is less of a technical issue and really more of a quality issue overall, where maybe our algorithm determined  

#### [0:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3510) |  that for whatever reason, this website is

not as relevant for some of those queries as it was before. And that's something that you probably need to take a look at from a bigger picture point of view. The one thing I always do when I see sites like that is to try to understand the situation before and after a little bit better. So see which pages received impressions and clicks from search before and after, and which  

#### [0:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3540) |  types of queries where there before and

after. And sometimes what I'll see is that there's either a change across the board, which to me is more a sign of overall, we're not really that happy with the quality of your website, or we don't think it's as relevant as it was before. Or I see that just some very high traffic queries have changed significantly. And sometimes those high traffic queries are things that are not really that relevant for your website.  

#### [0:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3570) |  So one thing I've seen, for example,

with some new sites is suddenly you had a page on how to log into Whatsapp, and that was really popular because it happened to rank really well for that. But you're a news website, so it's not that you're the authoritative source to logging in to Whatsapp. But because that page received a lot of traffic, a lot of impressions, if you just look at the overall traffic in total, then it will look like a significant drop. But it's actually you're getting more targeted traffic,  

#### [1:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3600) |  and it's traffic that matches better what

your website is actually about. So that's something where looking into those details, trying to understand the picture before and after, that can help you to better figure out what kinds of things you should be focusing on. SERGIO QUINONEZ: OK. Thank you. And it actually seems to be-- I mean, some of some of that situation seems to be happening because those high volume queries are  

#### [1:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3630) |  the ones that dropped the most. Those

are the ones that are not ranking at all. And I think that might be the case. JOHN MUELLER: OK. SERGIO QUINONEZ: Thank you, John. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. Cool. OK. Wow. I just noticed we're a bit over time. So let me pause here. I have the next Hangout session set up for Friday in the morning. So maybe less useful for those of you in the US, but more useful for those of you,  

#### [1:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxrjCw3VRjY&t=3660) |  maybe, in Europe or in India or

Asia. I hope you all stay safe until then. Thank you all for joining in, and look forward to seeing you again in one of the future Hangouts. DIDO GRIGOROV: Thank you, John. JOHN MUELLER: Bye, everyone. SERGIO QUINONEZ: Thank you. Bye.
