#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=0) |  JOHN MUELLER: All right. Welcome everyone to

today's Webmaster Central Office Hours Hangouts. My name is John Mueller. I'm a webmaster trends analyst at Google in Switzerland. And part of what we do are these Office Hour Hangouts, where people can join in and ask any question related to the website and web search. And we can try to find some answers. It looks like people are still jumping in, which is cool.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=30) |  There are a bunch of questions that

were submitted already on YouTube. So we can go through some of those. But as always, if any of you want to get started with a first question, you're welcome to jump in now. SAIDUL HOQUE: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. SAIDUL HOQUE: How are you? JOHN MUELLER: Pretty good. How are you? SAIDUL HOQUE: I'm good. John, I have two questions. So one of the questions is about one of our clients.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=60) |  We are trying to build a new

website for them. Now, when we did some competitor research, we have found some of our competitors, they build a website [INAUDIBLE] different way. For example, they create every single page for every single type of [INAUDIBLE].. For example, garden shed Sydney, they create one page. Garden shed sale Sydney, they get another page. And those pages actually rank on Google.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=90) |  And each page has a lot of

content. Now, I don't know whether they did the best practice to do this or not, because if you try to create pages in this way, the website would have more than 5,000 pages. So what is the best practice? What we can do? JOHN MUELLER: Now, so in general, if you're just creating pages for variations of keywords and you're all guiding people to the same content,  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=120) |  then we would consider that doorway pages.

And that would generally be something that the Web Spam Team and the Search Quality Team wouldn't be very fond of. So that's something I would try to avoid. On the other hand, if you really have unique content that you can bring for individual variations of keywords, then that might be something you can do. In general, my recommendation is to try to limit the number of pages that you have on a website  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=150) |  to focus more on quality and to

make those pages that you do have much stronger. So instead of taking a website that's kind of ranking OK and diluting it by creating 10 times or 20 times the amount of pages out of the same content, make those pages that you do have much stronger instead, so that they rank better. So that's the balance where I would tend to go more towards concentrating the value on those pages, making them stronger, so that they  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=180) |  can rank better for the more competitive

queries. And if you want to expand from that, then I think that's generally fine. I just wouldn't go the extreme of saying like, I will create pages for all variations of keywords, because probably you're just making it so that a page that ranks in the middle of the pack, I guess, would suddenly, because it's so diluted, just not rank at all in the search results.  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=210) |  So you might appear in the search

queries for some of those keywords. But nobody is searching for those long-tail variations that often. So it's not really that valuable. SAIDUL HOQUE: And the last question is also for the same client. So they actually sell garden sheds. So when we search garden shed on Google, we have noticed that the first 15 websites are e-commerce websites, except our one.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=240) |  So is there something Google decides-- OK,

for this keyword, they will only give importance to the e-commerce websites? Because my client's website is a little bit different. What they do-- people see their product. They can use the Get A Quote option. They contact with them and get a quote. They don't give the price on the website. So it is a little bit different from all the e-commerce websites. So is there something Google always decides like, OK, for this keyword, the e-commerce website will get the most benefit?  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=270) |  Is there something like this? JOHN MUELLER:

It's not so much that we would say, for individual keywords, we would prefer e-commerce websites. But we do try to understand what the intent behind the query is. And if we can tell that the intent is something where the user wants more information, then maybe we'll show more informational pages. If we can tell that the intent is more commercial, more transactional, that they want to buy one of these things, then maybe we'll show commercial pages more.  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=300) |  But I think the difference that you're

looking at is more that both of these types of pages are commercial pages. It's just one lets you buy it right away. And the other one has maybe a more detailed process to buy the product, which, from my point of view, those could be equally valuable. It's really hard for me to say that-- I would assume our algorithms wouldn't differentiate  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=330) |  between those two. They would say, these

are both e-commerce websites. One is just you call them or you send them an email or fill out a form to get to buy the product. And the other one, you go in and click the button to add it to your cart to buy the product. But they're both e-commerce websites. So if someone is looking for something with a commercial intent, then both of those kinds of sites would be relevant to show. SAIDUL HOQUE: Thank you.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=360) |  JOHN MUELLER: I think the bigger effect

is probably more what happens afterwards. When people come to your site, if they're able to convert well, that's something that's more, I guess, within the control of the site owner and less something from the SEO side that they have to worry about then. SAIDUL HOQUE: So you are trying to build it, the algorithm, to decide based on the intention of the user. So if it prefers e-commerce websites for that keyword, that means you are trying to rank e-commerce websites for that keyword?  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=390) |  JOHN MUELLER: It's not so much e-commerce

websites. But we try to understand what the intent is. And if the intent is really to buy something, then we will try to show something where they can buy something. And a lot of times, that intent can shift. For example, if a completely new kind of product comes out on the market, then, if you search for that, initially you want information. And then maybe a couple of months later, when it's available broadly, then people want to buy it.  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=420) |  So the same query can at one

point be informational and at some later time be more transactional and more commercial-oriented. SAIDUL HOQUE: Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: All right. Any other questions before we jump into the submitted ones? CHRIS TWETEN: Sure, I just had one actually. So I have a few clients in the same industry. And over time, they've actually started working  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=450) |  with each other naturally. But as the

webmaster of these multiple sites and that network is starting to grow a bit more, is there anything in particular I need to do so that Google doesn't think I'm doing a PBN or something? Because they're all closely related-- for example, a hotel that sells the tours of the other company I work with. JOHN MUELLER: I think, in general, that's less of an issue.  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=480) |  We're able to understand when sites work

together, when sites belong to the same company, all of that. And that's generally less of an issue. If you're cross-linking between these kind of sites, that sounds pretty reasonable. On the other hand, if it comes across as something that's clearly an advertisement, then that might be something where you just use a nofollow link. So if you have something that looks like a banner on top and it says, you can book-- I don't know-- special tours here and it looks like an advertisement,  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=510) |  then I would just treat it like

an advertisement. CHRIS TWETEN: OK. Yeah, we don't really use any banners like that. But we do have, say, like a ticket product page on the hotel's website. And that goes to the tour provider, for example. But it sounds like Google's good enough now. It's just like, every forum I go to, people sound paranoid. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I think, for the most part,  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=540) |  we can figure that out. And especially

if it's something that's kind of on the edge like this, then I wouldn't worry about it too much because, if we figure out that this is something we need to ignore, then we will ignore it. It's not that we will go in and penalize these websites from a web spam point of view. It would be different if this were something that were done in a really large scale. It's like if you're going to all other tourism sites and you're essentially buying links from them and you're doing some partnerships  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=570) |  with individual sites, then that would be

something where if the Web Spam Team looks at it they're like, the whole nature of this website is around unnatural links. Therefore, we will take action on all of these unnatural links. But if it's this small part where you're just working together with other companies and the rest of your website is ranking naturally, then that's not something I would spend too much time worrying about.  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=600) |  CHRIS TWETEN: OK, cool. Yeah, thanks a

lot. That's good to know, because one of them is a hotel chain. And they needs separate websites for each location. So yeah, I just wasn't sure how to handle that. But yeah, that works great. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. All right, let's go through some of the submitted questions. And as always, if there is something on your mind that's related, feel free to jump on in. And we should have some time towards the end  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=630) |  as well to catch up on other

things. When we search our brand name, Google shows our terms and conditions, type page, and site links. Is there any way not to show it? So the simple answer is, if you don't want those pages to be shown in search, you can use it noindex on that page. That does remove the page completely from search, though. So that's the extreme variation if you don't want it shown at all. But that's how you could do it. And the other approach here might  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=660) |  be to think about what you can

do to make it clearer that other pages within your website are more relevant. So you can make it so that the terms and condition page is still indexed, but to make it clearer perhaps that maybe some related products are more relevant rather than the terms and conditions page. And the general approach, when it comes to site links, is to have a clear hierarchy on the website,  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=690) |  so that we can clearly understand this

is the primary page, this is the top-level categories, these are pages associated with that category, those category pages, to have a clear structure on your website, rather than just everything on the same level. So instead of focusing on reducing crawl depths to make everything as flat as possible, which is sometimes something that people focus on, make sure that there's a really clear structure on your site.  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=720) |  And that structure is mirrored across your

whole site. So wherever we look at your site, we can understand this is the home page, these are the top-level categories, these are the important parts of the site, and these are pages that are related to individual parts of this site. And by doing that, usually we can figure out which pages are more relevant to show as site links. As recommended, we switched our breadcrumb markup from data-vocabulary to schema.  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=750) |  The website in question is redirecting users

from the root domain to the corresponding language folder. So domain.com redirects to a /en or /de depending on IP address. Search Console now shows an error under Navigation for the Roots folder. This seems to happen because the crawler follows a redirect, in this case to en, and then tries to use the data found on en for breadcrumb markup of the home page, which, of course, is not working.  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=780) |  Shall we remove the breadcrumb markup from

first level language folders? Or do you have other ways of getting rid of this error in Search Console? So I don't really know which error you're seeing in Search Console. So it's really hard to say what you should do next. In general though, if you're talking about your home page, probably there's not a lot of breadcrumb markup that you need to put on your home page because there is no trail leading to your home page.  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=810) |  So from that point of view, that

might be an easy solution. The other thing to keep in mind is that, if you're always redirecting Googlebot's IP addresses to /en because we crawl from the US, then we might have trouble indexing your de folder at all. So that's something to watch out for. Usually, my recommendation is more to use a banner and let people go to the right language version rather than to automatically redirect them  

#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=840) |  because, by automatically redirecting, you're running into

situations like this across the whole site, where you linked to one version, and then it redirects to a different version. And then if you check it at home-- like if you're based in Germany and check it at home, it looks completely different than what Googlebot would see went across from the US. So because of all of these things, usually I recommend just using a banner and showing that when you think a user is in the wrong location.

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=870) |  Let's see. We do a lot of

Google Ads marketing. And we're running millions of ads. Usually, it results in waves of requests from Google AdsBot. To have a stable user experience for customers, we dramatically scale our infrastructure once these waves are coming. Is there any way to nicely throttle Adsbot? Will it affect us negatively if we respond with 429-- oops. Just a second. Will it affect us negatively if we respond with 429 or 503  

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=900) |  to some of AdBot's requests? So in

general, there are two approaches that you can do with regards to crawling activity overall. So AdBot runs on the same infrastructure as Googlebot. So you can use the same tools as normal Googlebot for that. On the one hand, serving it these temporary errors, like 503's, is a good way to automatically throttle  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=930) |  Googlebot and let it crawl less. Another

option is a setting in Search Console. The setting in Search Console for the crawl rate is something that we respect across all crawlers. And we prioritize crawlers a little bit. So if you throttle things and you have a lot of irrelevant requests, then probably what will happen is we will still do our important crawls first. And then we'll just do fewer of these less relevant requests.  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=960) |  And generally speaking, that probably includes the

AdBot's landing page checks that are done. So another option that you can do. And finally, what you can also do-- if you're seeing that things are consistently confusing and crazy with regards to crawling, and especially if you're seeing really high crawl rates and your site generally is able to deal with that but it costs a lot of money and all of these things,  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=990) |  then, from the Crawl Stats page, Help

page in the Help Center, there's a link to a special form that you can fill out which goes to the Googlebot Team, where they can take a look and see if there's something on their side that they need to tune specifically for your site. All of these methods take a bit of time. So 503's are probably the fastest way to get Googlebot to crawl a little bit less frequently. But usually, the reduction in crawl rate  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1020) |  will happen on the next day or

the day after that. It happens automatically over time. The setting in Search Console also takes at least a day to be effective. And contacting the Googlebot Team through the forum, of course, depends a little bit on how things go on their side with regards to how quickly that can be picked up. So those are kind of the options there. I'm working in travel.  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1050) |  And we're massively affected by COVID-19. We

had to stop all marketing campaigns. And that resulted in no traffic from Google AdsBot. To reduce cross, we also scaled down infrastructure. A week ago, we started campaign on two of the 20 domains that resulted in huge traffic from Google AdBots to all of our domains and to the pages which are not currently advertised. The AdBot also checks the same page on every domain every five seconds for four to five hours.  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1080) |  So that last bit sounds kind of

strange. I don't know why that would happen. But I also don't know how that AdsBot setup is. But generally, the advice here is kind of the same as before, in that you essentially limit the amount of crawling that Googlebot can do. You can do that in Search Console. It's probably the easiest way to do that ahead of time if you're in the state of less crawling happening at the moment.  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1110) |  So that's probably the direction that I

would head there. During the course of the last four years, we migrated our website to a new domain five times. Wow, OK. After the last migration, our most important page has dropped in rankings for all its keywords. Other pages on the same website have recovered their rankings without problems. The important page was ranking for top five for several years and, during the previous domain migrations,  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1140) |  also recovered without problems. It indicates that

the page is meeting the needs and the search queries of our target audience. The migration was done [INAUDIBLE].. Right. This ranking drop feels more like an algorithmic penalty. The website doesn't have any manual actions. Now, we have a feeling that we might be affected by a page-level algorithmic penalty. Do you have any ideas, thoughts on what might have happened to our website? So overall, it's really hard if you do this many migrations over such a short period of time.  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1170) |  So that makes it a lot harder

to come to a situation where you have clear expectations of what would be normal in a case like this with a website and what-- I don't know-- broke along the way. If you're doing this many migrations, oftentimes, it's also a sign that something shady is around the website.  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1200) |  I really don't know your website. I

don't know why you're doing so many migrations. But this is something that we really commonly see. For example, when a site is kind of in a spammy area and they do some things on one domain, and then suddenly that the main doesn't rank that well anymore, and then they move to the next domain and they kind of do the same things and doesn't work that well anymore. And then they move to the next domain. So that's something that, personally, I've seen quite a bit happen. I don't know if that's the case with your website.  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1230) |  Maybe there are other reasons why you're

doing so many migrations. But that's the first thing where, if I came across something like this with regards to a website, I would be cautious. In general, we have algorithms that do all kinds of things. It's not the case that we would have an algorithm that would try to manually-- or try to penalize a single page on a website. But it's certainly possible, over time, that the algorithms will look at your website  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1260) |  and rank it differently and adjust its

visibility over time. Whoops, now we have a coffee grinder in the other room. The fun parts of working at home. So from my point of view, I don't think that's something that is tied to a penalty specific to a page. That's something where, personally, I would try to take a step back and think about what you can do  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1290) |  overall to improve those pages. ANDREJ KOCAK:

Yeah, can I just ask a follow-up question? Because this is my question. JOHN MUELLER: Oh, fantastic. ANDREJ KOCAK: Yeah. So the reason for migration is not some kind of spammy links or something like that. The reason is we don't really want to migrate our domain, but there has been a problem with the legislation in the country we have our domain in.  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1320) |  And so we were forced to migrate

our website so many times. And the website is generally doing very good. But when the government comes across it, there is some kind of problem we need to resolve this way because there is no other way to resolve it. So we really don't know what we are supposed to do right now. We know that it's not ideal to have this many migrations. But since there is no other way, is there something we can do to improve that or to recover from these massive drops?  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1350) |  JOHN MUELLER: Wow. I think there is

always a tricky situation to be in. I am happy to take a look. If you want to post the URL that you're seeing these problems with maybe in the chat, I can pass that on to the Search Quality Team as well to double-check. But usually, if you're seeing this kind of an effect on a single page across a bigger website, then that sounds like something where the algorithms are just  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1380) |  generally unsure about the website overall. And

that might be a side effect of all these migrations, where we have to pass the signals from one domain to the next one. And at some point, it can happen at something along the way doesn't forward that well anymore. So if some of the redirects along the way don't work anymore, if some of the old domains don't work anymore, then suddenly we  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1410) |  lose a little bit of context that

we might have collected with more persistent setup. But I'm happy to take a look and pass that on to the team. You can post it here. And I can check that out after the Hangout. ANDREJ KOCAK: Yeah, that'd be great. That'd be very helpful. JOHN MUELLER: OK. Cool, thanks. I have a client in a highly competitive market where being in the Mapbox can mean the difference between success  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1440) |  and failure. How does the quality of

the website affect the position in the Mapbox? So I think Mapbox probably refers to the Google My Business listings. From our point of view, I don't really have a lot of insight into how Google My Business does the ranking within their local search results. I don't really have that much insight that I can give you there. But I do know there are special forums for Google My Business  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1470) |  business owners. I would double-check there. It's

very possible that some of the folks active in these forums have some tips, and tricks, and things that work well things that don't work well. I doubt that there is a clear list of-- So many people. Yeah, I doubt that there is like a clear list of ranking factors when it comes to Google My Business that the Google My  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1500) |  Business team would be able to just--

So on March 23, we used the indexing API to estimate 50,000 salary pages that didn't contain job posting data to Google during the indexing API beta, we were told that we could use the API to submit salary pages for purposes of the estimated salary. On the same day we saw our pages with job posting schema get deindexed.  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1530) |  You recently mentioned on Twitter that the

indexing API is only for job posting and live streamed structured data. For everything, else just use site maps. Could this be the root cause of our job posting schema pages getting deindexed? Going forward, we will not use the indexing API for salary pages. Can you confirm if this is the root cause of the job posting schema pages being deindexed? So first of all, no, this wouldn't  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1560) |  be the reason for existing pages to

be dropped from the index. So when it comes to indexing API, essentially what happens is we have to crawl those pages to see what is on those pages, to see if the right structured data is on those pages. And if the right structured data is on those pages, then we can process those pages. Whereas, if we look at those pages and don't find the right kinds of structured data,  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1590) |  then that's something where, essentially, we would

just ignore what we just crawled. We wouldn't pass that on. We wouldn't use it for indexing. So in a case like this where, if you're submitting pages with the indexing API that don't have the right kinds of structured data, we would just ignore that. It wouldn't negatively affect the other pages on your site that we already have indexed. So that's something where probably this kind  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1620) |  of thing that you're seeing is completely

unrelated. I have two sites that sell very similar products. But all the branding content and product descriptions are unique and written in a tone of the voice for that brand. However, the backend code and the website structure is the same for both sites. Would this cause duplication issues between the sites? It might.  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1650) |  My feeling is that, if you have

two websites that are just slightly different, then that's not something where I would worry about that too much with regards to duplication, especially if they're focused on a unique audience. So from that point of view, I don't really see a big problem here. I think it would be different if you have a lot of different websites that are essentially selling the same products. And that's something where, obviously, it  

#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1680) |  makes it a little bit trickier for

us to figure out which one of those pages to show. So again, going back to the multiple websites, if you have things that are essentially unique on their own-- so if you have these two types of web sites are slightly targeting different things, I wouldn't worry about it. If you have a large number of them, then that's something that would probably be a bit different. Would it be considered abnormal for a relatively established  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1710) |  site to no longer appear or receive

impressions in discover? Search Console is showing zero impressions clicks after getting hundreds of clicks and thousands of impressions daily. This happened immediately after a rather large early November update that caused a stir, which would suggest a correlation, though not necessarily causation. So changes in visibility and discover can happen over time.  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1740) |  And we have lots of algorithms that

essentially affect large parts of search. And that would include discover. So it's very possible that a site might for some time get a lot of traffic and visibility in discover. And over time, our algorithms change. And that visibility essentially goes away. Or it changes over time. It can also happen that your site currently doesn't have any traffic from discover.

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1770) |  And over time, we recognize that actually

it doesn't make sense to show a little bit differently like that. We're thinking of changing the main nav anchors by removing gender-specific terms and listing them as clean text under a dropdown for gender. For example, we currently have men Citizen watches. This would change to Citizen watches placed under a dropdown menu for men's watches. Would this affect the ranking of men's Citizen watches? Or can the crawler understand the subnav dropdown?  

#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1800) |  So usually, we can understand the context

of pages fairly well. And if you're just moving things around from direct anchor text to more indirect anchor text, in that you're shuffling the categories around a little bit, then, from my point of view, that seems like a reasonable thing to do and wouldn't necessarily be something where I'd assume something negatively  

#### [0:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1830) |  would come out of that. That said,

anytime you do restructure your website, it does mean that we have to relearn the setup of your website a bit. And that can result in ranking changes. So that's something where I-- my general recommendation for these kind of things, if you're a little bit worried about that,  

#### [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1860) |  would be to test it out and

try it out on a small part of your website, where you get significant traffic but it's not a crazy amount of traffic. I'm running a website that deals in beauty care products for Thailand. After the last Google update, I noticed that the site ranking has dropped and noticed that all informative review-based YouTube, Facebook profiles started to show up  

#### [0:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1890) |  on the first line of search results

for a lot of the search queries. My website was ranking almost all of the product pages, category pages, and other pages. What's the issue? Is Google ignoring beauty products related to e-commerce websites and prioritizes informative sites? If it is, then how can we bring back the ranking? Or can you help me take a look? So in general, these kind of ranking changes can happen over time.  

#### [0:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1920) |  That's not something where I would say

it's like Google's algorithms have decided to only start showing these kinds of pages. But rather, we try to figure out which pages to show appropriately in search. And that can change over time. So that's something where it can certainly happen that a page, or type of page, or a set of pages is ranking really well in search. And then over time, our algorithms  

#### [0:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1950) |  try to figure out that maybe this

set of pages isn't as relevant to these user queries as we initially thought. And we have to rethink that. Similarly, it can happen the other way around, that our algorithm thinks, well, these sort of pages actually are much more relevant now than we thought they were before. And maybe we should show them a little bit more visibly.  

#### [0:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=1980) |  We have the same database for two

price comparison sites in two different countries which we have shown in their native language. One site is extremely popular in its country, while the other is just a veteran in its respective country. Will it change anything if we implement hreflang? They're about 15- to 20-year-old domains. So I think, from the age itself, I wouldn't see that as a factor  

#### [0:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2010) |  here at all. With regards to just

using hreflang to make one site more visible in the search results, that wouldn't work primarily because what happens with hreflang is, if we show the other version of the site in the search results, then we will swap it out based on the hreflang. If we're showing neither of these sites in the search results at the moment, then there is nothing for us to swap out.  

#### [0:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2040) |  So you can't use hreflang to make

a site more popular in a country based on the popularity of a similar site or the same site in another country. So essentially, what you would need to do here is really work to improve the standing of that one website in that specific country. And it's not something where you can just use technical methods to tell Google, like, hey, I'm really popular in one country.  

#### [0:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2070) |  You should make me really popular in

all countries. That doesn't really work. That's not something that users expect, either. It's something where you really need to make sure that your website is really well-received in that country on its own. I've been waiting for two months to hear back from a reconsideration request I submitted in February. Is this normal? How long should I wait? And when should I submit again?  

#### [0:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2100) |  So sometimes, reconsideration requests do take quite

a bit of time. I think two months seems like a pretty long time. So I don't know if that's still within the normal range. But it's still something where I'd say it can certainly happen, that it takes this amount of time to be reviewed. What I would do also, in a case like this with a reconsideration request, is to check in with the help forum to make  

#### [0:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2130) |  sure that at least the site that

you have-- the way that you have it set up now is as correct as possible with regards to the issues from the web spam side that came up. And oftentimes, the folks in the webmaster help forums-- they have a lot of practice with all kinds of different sites. And they can help you to figure out how to make that actually work a little bit better. I have anchor text and backlinks from adult content sites.  

#### [0:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2160) |  And some of my pages rank as

high as position 1 for clearly adult content queries, as evidenced by the search results. Is disavowing adult content sites the best thing to do? I don't have any manual actions. You can definitely disavow these links, if you want. In general, just because you have links from adult sites and just because you might be ranking for some of those queries doesn't mean that you would not be ranking for the normal queries  

#### [0:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2190) |  on your website. So this is something

where people often feel that this is negative SEO because I rank for these queries I don't want to rank for. But at the same time, this wouldn't negatively be affecting the queries that you do want to rank for, which probably aren't the these kinds of queries. So from that point of view, that's something-- disavowing them probably makes sense. It reduces the possibility that your site  

#### [0:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2220) |  would rank for those queries. But just

because it's ranking for one set of queries doesn't mean that it won't rank for other kinds of queries. It's not that we suddenly assume that your website is an adult website too. Looking to gain access to the 3D AR for Google Search and Google Ads program. I've applied through the forum, but I haven't heard back. I have nearly 1,000 products that we can upload for retailers who really need the extra help at this time.  

#### [0:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2250) |  That's really cool. If you can send

me a link to your site, I can double-check with the team. I know the team that works on structured data has been really busy with a lot of the Coronavirus launches that have happened recently. So it might be that they're a little bit stretched thin in this regard. But I'm happy to take a look and see if there's something that we can do to speed things up in general there. Maybe that's also something where we can just help the team with better documentation  

#### [0:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2280) |  to set the expectations a little bit

clearer. Are there ever webmaster events that are in North American time zones? They always seem to happen at 3:00 AM for me. I do two of these during the week-- one of them towards evening my time, which is more US timezone-friendly, and the other one here on Friday mornings, which is more timezone-friendly for the APAC folks.  

#### [0:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2310) |  So depending on your location, one or

the other is probably a good match. Is redirecting a route domain a bad practice? I found that kind of common for multilingual sites. Since every language has their own subfolder, they have one for en us, too. So they usually redirect the root folder to en us home page. For example, IBM.com will redirect to IBM.com/us-en.  

#### [0:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2340) |  Is that a bad practice? If so,

how should we handle this? Also, IBM seems to put their root domains as x-default, even if it's a page that's being redirected. Is that a bad idea? So actually, the x-default setup for something like this is something that we have documented and recommended. So if you have a redirecting home page, then that is generally a good match for people who aren't within the hreflang set that you currently have.  

#### [0:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2370) |  So for example, if you have pages

for English, French, and German and someone with a Spanish browser comes to you, then it's usually a good idea for us to send them to your redirecting home page because, from there, you can best make that choice between where they should be guided to. So that x-default part is essentially something that we would recommend there. Redirecting home pages in general,  

#### [0:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2400) |  like I mentioned before, is something that

personally I don't like that much because it makes it a lot harder to diagnose issues. Technically, you can do it. You just need to keep in mind that, if you're redirecting Googlebot back from the language versions themselves as well, then it's possible that we would not see any of the non-English versions. So if you just redirect the root of the home page to different language locations, like /de and /en,  

#### [0:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2430) |  and if people go directly to any

of these language versions and they're not redirected, then that's generally OK. The hard part is really if you redirect people from the German version to the English version because you think that the English version is a better match for them. Then it's very possible that Googlebot would have a lot of trouble finding and being able to index any of the non-English content. But that's the second step there,  

#### [0:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2460) |  from the redirecting home page. What I

usually recommend instead is to have a country picker, either as a country picker page, which is also kind of tricky with regards to usability, or if you can recognize that a user is coming from a different location to show a banner on top and say, hey, it looks like you're coming from an English-speaking country. Here is a link to our English home page. Or here is a link to the English version of this current page.  

#### [0:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2490) |  And let the user make that decision.

That usually makes it a lot easier, on the one hand for users, on the other hand, for a search engine as well, because then we can call and index all of these different versions. And we don't get sent in the wrong direction. Oh, OK. Running towards the end of the Hangout, still a handful of questions left. But maybe I can switch over to questions from your side, if there is anything on your end that's still pending.  

#### [0:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2520) |  VALBHAV DESHPANDE: Hey, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi.

VALBHAV DESHPANDE: I represent a farmer e-commerce brand in India. I had a couple of queries regarding that. So one of the queries is, we see a lot of discrepancy in location-specific keyword rankings. Also, we are an e-commerce brand. We operate across the country. But we see that, for the general keyword, which is not location-specific, we are ranking probably fourth in one city, but not in top for a different city.  

#### [0:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2550) |  JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, that can happen. VALBHAV

DESHPANDE: So what are the issues or the causes or the solutions that you would recommend for this? JOHN MUELLER: I mean, usually, that's a sign that our algorithms believe that users really want local information for those kind of queries in those specific locations. And that's something if you don't have that kind of local information, that kind  

#### [0:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2580) |  of local content, then that makes it

possible for us to say, well, maybe we should show more local content instead of this more general version of content. From that point of view, it's not something where I would say you're doing something wrong. But rather, our algorithms believe that maybe your site isn't as relevant for those queries in those specific locations. And if you think that it is relevant for those queries  

#### [0:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2610) |  in those locations, then that's something where

you need to make sure that it's a lot clearer on your website, and that it is relevant for those queries and locations. VALBHAV DESHPANDE: OK. One specific thing on the website is that our default location is a particular city. And for that particular city, the rankings are quite good. And that is actually visible on the website. And that is indexed by Google as well. So do you think that this could be a problem, where all the users from different cities  

#### [0:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2640) |  are exposed to this particular city? So

should we remove the city and make it generic? Do you think that would solve the problem? JOHN MUELLER: That might help, yeah. So if there is one city that you're already highlighting, that's something where I could certainly imagine that that makes it a little bit trickier. So I know, for example, we had similar issues--  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XlVDHtDF3L8/maxres3.jpg)



#### [0:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2670) |  or I don't know if they were

issues. But I saw similar things with some-- what is it?-- classified sites in the US, where they would show different content on their home page based on their location of the user. And they would try to do that on a city level. And that meant, every time we called the home page, a lot of the content that they were presenting was based on San Francisco and Silicon Valley kind of area. And that essentially made it so that, for us, the home page was  

#### [0:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2700) |  very San Francisco-oriented. So even though they

had content for all other locations, it was something where they were focusing so much on San Francisco with regard to the content that we thought, well, probably this is a website specific for San Francisco. So that's something where, similarly, if you really focus on one city on your website, then it might be that we look at your website and say, well, this is really focused for that one city.  

#### [0:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2730) |  Maybe it's not so relevant for other

cities. And if you can reduce that focus or make it so that, at least by default, that city is not something that's standing in the foreground, then probably that would help to even things out a little bit. VALBHAV DESHPANDE: Yep. Got it, thank you. Another question that I had was, so since we are in pharma vertical, we are focusing a lot on EAP elements to add on the website. So would you say that adding those elements on top of the page compared to the bottom of the page--  

#### [0:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2760) |  does it have an impact on the

overall rankings that Google might consider? JOHN MUELLER: I wouldn't see that as something as a primary ranking factor. But for users, that probably does make a difference. That's something where I would primarily focus on this as usability as a conversion factor and less as an SEO element. VALBHAV DESHPANDE: All right, thanks. Oh, one last question that I had was--  

#### [0:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2790) |  I'm really sorry. This is the last

one. JOHN MUELLER: No problem. VALBHAV DESHPANDE: So this is regarding duplication on the website. So we have multiple molecules, a composition of the medicines. And we have similar content for multiple pages, which has the same constituents and the same elements in them. So would you say that duplication in these aspects would not cause an issue? Or would you recommend that we should try to make it unique or add more elements so that the overall page gets a bit more  

#### [0:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2820) |  unique than before? JOHN MUELLER: I don't

know. I would try to look at it more from the point of view of what people are actually searching for. And I really don't know that area so much with regards to what they're actually searching for. If people are searching for very specific variations, then that might be something where it makes sense to include that on your website. But if you just have all of these variations and people  

#### [0:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2850) |  are primarily searching for the category of

molecules, in this case, then maybe it doesn't make sense to include those smaller, lower level pages. This is also something that you can probably test fairly well on your website, where you take one section of your site where you're receiving enough traffic so that you have some reasonable numbers to compare, and then you make an A/B test there, where you take a small set of those pages  

#### [0:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2880) |  and you do them in one way

and a small set of pages you do them another way. And then you see what is the overall traffic to this set of pages versus that set of pages. VALBHAV DESHPANDE: Got it. Thank you so much. Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. VALBHAV DESHPANDE: That's it. JOHN MUELLER: All right, any other questions from any of you all? IVAN KOKUTI: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. IVAN KOKUTI: Yeah, I just had a question about duplication of code.  

#### [0:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2910) |  So we have two sites. And they

both target the same, similar, or pretty much the same products. But the branding for both sites is different. The content is different. The product descriptions are different. Everything's pretty much unique other than the code. The backend, and the site structures are the same. I just wanted to know if that would cause an issue between the sites in regards  

#### [0:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2940) |  to ranking or duplication of code. JOHN

MUELLER: Usually, that would be OK. I mean, especially if you're targeting different types of users, then that's something where I wouldn't really worry about that. That seems reasonable. IVAN KOKUTI: OK, that's good. One other question-- we've got quite a large navigation for both the sites. And we target male and female with different products.  

#### [0:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=2970) |  We want to clean the navigation, so

you have the products listed underneath men's-- so you have men's watches, men's jewelry, but instead just have the product terms rather than gender-specific with the anchor text. Would that have an impact in the rankings for those pages? JOHN MUELLER: My guess is we would still figure that out.  

#### [0:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=3000) |  And probably, it would be pretty neutral

overall. But it could. Depending on how your site is structured now, it could be a pretty big change in the way that your navigation is set up, that your hierarchy of the site is set up. So that could be something that would have an effect there. My recommendation there would be to try to test that, if at all possible. Like before, to take a significant part of your site where you get enough traffic that you can compare things  

#### [0:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=3030) |  and try that variation versus the current

variation and see if that has any effect there. And my general feeling is probably the overall effect will be minimal. But it's really hard to say offhand. IVAN KOKUTI: Sure, that's great. Cheers. JOHN MUELLER: All right. FARAZ KHAN: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. FARAZ KHAN: There's just one question I just thought  

#### [0:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=3060) |  I could get the answer to. We

have two pages, one page for a particular keyboard. We have [INAUDIBLE] page ranking for it, as well as the dedicated page [INAUDIBLE] OK. So what we have observed is that the competition that is ranking for that particular keyword have their own page. And we do not have a dedicated page. We somehow seem to rank similarly. So should we consider targeting our homepage  

#### [0:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=3090) |  for that particular keyword and redirecting that

specific page to the homepage? JOHN MUELLER: That's something you can do. It's not something where I would say you would always want to do that. So it's fairly common that both the home page and maybe a category page or a product page rank for the same kind of query. And it can happen that one of these pages  

#### [0:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=3120) |  ranks more visibly than the other one.

But essentially, that's something that you can control a little bit based on the amount of content that you have on your sites, based on the hierarchy of your website. And that's something that you can control, in a way, where you can make the decision on what you would like to have happen there. So if you feel strongly that your home page is a much better page for this kind of query, then make sure that it's really clear to all search engines  

#### [0:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=3150) |  when they come to your website that

the home page is the right page to show for that query. And similarly, if you want people to go to product page or category page instead, then make it clear that this is really the page that people should go to for that specific query. For example, if you have exactly the same content on your home page, or if you have a full set of the multiple product categories that you have on your home page as well, then sometimes it's hard for us to tell which of these pages  

#### [0:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=3180) |  is a better one to show to

users. So this decision is essentially up to you. And if you choose to have one or the other pages to be shown visibly, or you prefer to have it more visibly shown for individual queries, then you need to make that as clear as possible. FARAZ KHAN: Thanks. [INAUDIBLE] environment, for example, the landscaping [INAUDIBLE] should that not be a concern for us? Because what we observed was that the competitors, even  

#### [0:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=3210) |  though they did not have a dedicated

page, the homepage, then that seems to be at the highest authority or the highest [INAUDIBLE]. So shouldn't the landscape be something that we need to consider for this? JOHN MUELLER: I wouldn't worry about what your competitors are doing because maybe they're doing it wrong. Or maybe they don't want to have this happen and it's happening accidentally. I would really think more about what you want to have happen.  

#### [0:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=3240) |  Which one of those pages do you

want to have ranked in the search results? And maybe it's your home page. Maybe you want everyone to recognize your brand, your overall company for this query. That's fine. That's your decision. Maybe you prefer to have people go to a product page, where they can convert quicker. That's another option. But essentially, that's a decision that you can make. And that's one where you can focus on your metrics. What do you really want to have happen? Do you think people need to find out about your company?  

#### [0:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=3270) |  Maybe the home page is better. Do

you think people would be interested in just going off and buying the product? Then maybe the product itself is better. FARAZ KHAN: Thanks, John. Thank you very much. Take care and stay safe. JOHN MUELLER: Sure, thanks. You too. OK, let's maybe take a break here. I'll set up the next batch of Hangouts. And hopefully, they'll be a little bit less disruptive along the way.  

#### [0:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlVDHtDF3L8&t=3300) |  If you have any questions along the

way, feel free to drop me a note on Twitter or to join us in the WebMaster Help Forums as well. Thank you all for joining in. I wish you all a great weekend. And stay safe, stay healthy. Don't do anything crazy, like go outside, I guess. All right, see you, everyone. Bye.
