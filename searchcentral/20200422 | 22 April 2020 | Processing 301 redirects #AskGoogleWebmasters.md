#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJEXnCKxV88&t=0) |  [MUSIC PLAYING] JOHN MUELLER: Today's question has

been submitted by Riccardo. Riccardo is asking, "After a 301 redirect, how long does it take Google to start ranking the new URL instead of the old one? I did a redirect from A to B with 301, and then Google indexed both of them instead of the new one. And Google is still ranking the old URL." That's a good one, Riccardo. Thanks for asking. And that's something that even the SEO team within Google wanted to ask us.

team with SEO questions, but fortunately for you, we can help you. At a general level, a 301 redirect is just a signal for canonicalization. You're telling us you'd prefer to have the destination page indexed rather than the originating one. And that's fine. However, we use lots of factors for canonicalization, not just redirects. I mentioned that in one of the earlier videos, too, so take a look at that. In practice, what happens here is we spot the redirect.

factors. If everything aligns, we'll focus on the destination page. To make that easier, make sure that you update the internal links, the sitemap files, and other references to the originating page so that they all point to the destination page. Another quirk here is that if you explicitly look for the old originating page, we'll try to show that in search. For example, if you specifically look for the old URL directly, we'll probably be able to show that to you,

the new one. You can double check that it's working right in Search Console, using the URL inspection tool there. And there you can clearly see which URL is currently selected as canonical. And if that's not the page that you want, look for signals pointing to the old URL and fix those. Thanks for asking, Riccardo, and don't forget to like and subscribe. [MUSIC PLAYING]
