## User-generated content on your site #AskGoogleWebmasters

In this episode of Ask Google Webmasters, John Mueller goes over how Google search engine approaches user generated content on websites, how to block this content from being indexed (if needed), and how to flag links within user-generated content. The question was submitted by @amitkrseo. Thank you!

from Amit Kumar, who is asking, "Google ranks web pages based on content, relevancy, and quality, among other factors. Does this apply in the case of user-generated content as well?"

only allow them to be index if you're happy with the quality. For example, you could block them with a noindex robots meta tag, which you remove once you're happy. Figuring out how much it takes for you to be happy with the content is up to you. Some sites collect information on how happy other users are with the content, which might be useful for this. Finally, one thing to keep in mind with user-generated content is that, by default,

that were added. For these, we have a way of telling us that these links are user-generated content with the rel="ugc" link attribute. I hope you found this useful. Thank you for submitting. I'll link to the details in the description below. And see you next time on "Ask Google Webmasters." [MUSIC PLAYING]
