#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=0) |  JOHN MULLER: All right, welcome, everyone, to

today's Webmaster Central office hours hangout. My name is John Muller. I am a webmaster trends analyst at Google here in Switzerland, and part of what we do are these webmaster office hour hangouts, where people can join in and ask their questions around their website and web search, and we try to find some answers or make sure that we pass some feedback onto the team here as well.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=30) |  I hope you're all doing well, and

that you're enjoying summer, if you're in an area where you have summer at the moment. Or I guess fall or winter if you're in the southern hemisphere. I hope you all find some time to take off in between as well, despite all of the crazy situations around coronavirus. A bunch of stuff was submitted already, but if any of you want to get started with the first question,  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=60) |  you're welcome to join in and jump

in now. AUDIENCE: Hi, John. JOHN MULLER: Hi. AUDIENCE: Maybe you remember that, in the last Webmaster, I asked you about the problem of favicon that disappeared since, now, it's three months. And I was suspecting that was related to the site  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=90) |  not being indexed in the root because

a subdomain for each language. And you told me to wait still a couple of weeks to see something change. And I waited, but nothing happens, and so still favicon not showing. Now, it's about three months, so maybe there is something weird. Maybe I can drop the site in the chat? JOHN MULLER: Yeah, if you can drop it into the chat, I'm happy to pass that onto the team to double check.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=120) |  AUDIENCE: Here it is, because I don't

know if it's-- I mean, if it can be related because I double checked the guidelines of Google should be followed, and the dimension of the icon, I think, is fine. And so after so long, it's strange, because I think that the favicon [INAUDIBLE] with the [INAUDIBLE],, I imagine, because people maybe is more likely to click on an icon instead  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=150) |  of the generic word icon, maybe. JOHN

MULLER: I don't know. I think that would be hard to see, if that's directly the case. I think it probably helps people, especially those that understand the site already, but I don't think it would change much in behavior for generic users. I don't know your site yet.  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=180) |  But still, regardless of what exactly it

would change, it seems like this is something that we should be able to fix on our side. AUDIENCE: OK. I put it on the chat. JOHN MULLER: Cool, thanks. Now, I saw you also mentioned what the problem is. That makes it a lot easier, because I get the chat transcript afterwards, and sometimes, I have to puzzle which site was what. But that's perfect. AUDIENCE: Thanks.  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=210) |  AUDIENCE: Hey, John, how are you? JOHN

MULLER: Hi. AUDIENCE: My question is regarding something, which is called entity [INAUDIBLE]. If you search for something like mobile games or video games, it will show [INAUDIBLE] at the top in a CRP. So what we can do, or how we can optimize to be there? Or how do they pick these entities, and is there something that we can do to optimize our website or to improve our chances being in there?  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=240) |  JOHN MULLER: Essentially, it tries to understand

the entities on the page directly. So it's not that you have to do any special markup or do anything specific on your pages, but more that we understand that this is an entity that is talked about on the web in general, and is not something that's just limited to your specific website. So in practice, that means when we crawl  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=270) |  and index the whole web, we find

a lot of these items we can recognize that it's talking about the same entity. They have same information, and then based on that, we can try to figure out where this entity fits in with the rest of the web. But it's not that you need to do any special markup or [INAUDIBLE] to your pages for that. AUDIENCE: So it's basically about the signals that Google collects from different sources?  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=300) |  JOHN MULLER: Yeah, yeah. It's from information

that we recognize from across the web, because it's important to us to understand that this is not something that's unique to one particular site, but rather other people understand that this is an entity. And based on that, we can say, well, we should treat it as an entity as well. AUDIENCE: Thank you. AUDIENCE: Hey, John. JOHN MULLER: Hi. AUDIENCE: How's it going?  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=330) |  JOHN MULLER: Pretty good. How are you?

AUDIENCE: I'm doing great. Thank you very much. John, I have a question regarding the URL inspection tool. Are there any sort of crawling issues at the current time, especially new sites? JOHN MULLER: Not that I'm aware of. I know that sometimes we have fluctuations in our pipelines that things get a little bit slow, and sometimes that ends up being visible in the URL inspection tool. But I'm not aware of anything broader that's blocked there.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=360) |  Are you seeing specific problems at the

moment? AUDIENCE: Yeah. I mean, that's the thing the new sites have you're working on. We've seen it 10 times. JOHN MULLER: So you're submitting the home page for indexing essentially? AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] not getting the--  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=390) |  JOHN MULLER: Yeah. Hard to say-- AUDIENCE:

[INAUDIBLE]. JOHN MULLER: Yeah, it's hard to say, but I think the important part also with these tools, especially when you're submitting things to indexing, is that we just don't index all content that we see. And sometimes we see things in the URL inspection tool, and our systems like, eh, we don't know if we need to index  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=420) |  is right away. But the more signals

that we have about content, the more likely we end up going there and trying to get it indexed as well. So especially if you're seeing things like new sites not being indexed immediately, then I would tend to give it a little bit more time and maybe try to work on other ways to make that site known, which could be a variety of different things, I guess, like working with the site map file,  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=450) |  making sure that everything is lined up

properly from a technical point of view, those kind of things. AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] like a crawling issue rather than an index issue. We submitted. Nothing happens [INAUDIBLE] searched on. So [INAUDIBLE] search results. I think we've tried this for multiple sites, but it's not working out. JOHN MULLER: Yeah, I don't know.  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=480) |  It's hard to say. I'm not aware

of anything that would mean that that's blocked completely. I think, if that were the case, then we would see a lot of complaints on Twitter and in the forums. So it might just be something temporary, that you should try it again a little bit later. If you're seeing this regularly happening, then I'd just recommend starting a thread in the forum together with URL so that folks there can double  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=510) |  check to see if things are aligned

with regards to crawling and try with their own tools, and maybe they have general feedback for the site overall. AUDIENCE: Sure. Thank you, [INAUDIBLE]. JOHN MULLER: Sure. All right, any last questions before we jump into the submitted ones? AUDIENCE: I have a question, John. Hi. JOHN MULLER: Sure. AUDIENCE: So actually, I have two questions, actually.  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=540) |  So my first question is, recently, when

I Google my brand name, on the first or second page of the results, there's a site review website that pops up. And it has a rich result snippet with the rating and stuff, and it's just a lot of user submitted reviews about the website. And I'm not sure what impact this actually has, whether directly, or I suppose there would be an indirect impact if a user sees  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=570) |  the reviews, and they are looking for

reviews about the website. So I know there is that aspect of it, but I was wondering if there is any other aspect, or any other impact on my site based on links that are maybe shared in the reviews. Or I know [INAUDIBLE] can sometimes be used to understand context of a page. So if there's a negative sentiment generally on the page, could that have any sort of impact  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=600) |  on the performance or ranking of my

website? JOHN MULLER: I don't think you'd see any effect on the ranking of your website from that. I think, at most, what might happen is that people stumble across that in the search results for your company name. They're like, oh, what does this mean, and then they get lost in that website. But it's not that the existence of such a page would negatively affect your site.  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=630) |  Even if there are some negative reviews

on there-- I mean, on the internet there are all kinds of things. So that's something where I wouldn't directly assume that would have a negative impact. Sometimes, it makes sense to try to create other kinds of content that [INAUDIBLE] up, especially for things like a query for your company name, but it's always a question of where you invest your time. If people are already searching for your company name,  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=660) |  they know where to go anyway. So

I don't know. It's not always straightforward to say, oh, you should create more pages with your company name on it just so that you can cover the whole search results with your favorable content. AUDIENCE: So basically, don't need to worry about that too much. JOHN MULLER: Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it. AUDIENCE: OK, good. And then I had another [INAUDIBLE].. So my website has a forum.  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=690) |  It's located on a subdomain of the

main property, so it's not part of the same domain. And it's a really old forum, so there's, I think, over 100,000 users. And I'm realizing, recently, that a lot of these users, maybe more than 90% of them are very new, and they're abusing the user profiles for link building schemes, essentially. And I'm wondering what this could do to my site,  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=720) |  whether the subdomain-- the forum, or whether

it could affect my main site at all. And I know the subdomain is seen differently from the main site, but it links-- I would say it links pretty well to the main site. We have the nav menu that goes to all the main categories on the main site, and a lot of the user submitted content, a lot of the posts and stuff,  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=750) |  will also include links to the main

site. So should I-- there's a lot of pages, so I'm wondering, should I go in and clean up all those links, remove all those user profiles? And if so, what's the best way to handle that? AUDIENCE: No-follow, no? JOHN MULLER: Yeah, I think no-follow is definitely the first step I would take there. Especially if you're unsure about those profiles, and people are using them for link building, then making sure that those pages have no-follow on them sometimes makes it less interesting for people  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=780) |  to abuse the forum for that. So

that's the first thing I would take there, but I would also try to see if you can find ways to algorithmically recognize this kind of abuse and spammy content and no-index it by default. So that might be something where, if you can tell that a user has been around for a certain period of time, or they've contributed positively to the forum, then make their profile indexable,  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=810) |  and otherwise, keep it no-index-- these kinds

of things. Because on the one hand, the links can have an effect there, that our algorithms might look at this and say, if we can isolate those profiles, and we can just ignore those links; if we can't isolate the profiles, which is often the case, then maybe we'll be ignoring all of the links from the forum. And if this is on a subdomain, then it might be that our algorithms are not able to completely understand the relationship  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QPh3T7oemxM/hq1.jpg)



#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=840) |  between the subdomain and domain domain, and

they ignore all of the links across the whole domain. So that's something where I'd try to clean that up as much as possible. It's probably something where you don't see an urgent or critical change if you make that clean-up, but it would have a longer term effect. If we can really understand this is good content, and this is what you want to have published, and it's tied to your other website, which is also  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=870) |  really good content, then that helps us

a lot more, versus if we understand, well, this website is OK, and this one is filled with spam, and they're connected. So should they be forwarding signals back and forth, or should they be completely separated from our side? It's hard to say. AUDIENCE: So just to confirm, you're saying there is a risk that the main site's links could be seen as spammy as well because of a lot of spam  

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=900) |  on subdomain? JOHN MULLER: Yeah. It's not

so much that we would see them as spammy, but our algorithms could learn to ignore those links. And essentially, that's something that automatically happens. We see a lot of user generated links on a site, and we think, well, probably the webmaster isn't aware of what's actually happening here. We'll just ignore these to be on the safe side. And that might end up with us ignoring  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=930) |  the other links on your site as

well, which is probably not what you want. AUDIENCE: Right, yeah. And then the other thing is, a lot of these profiles, I notice that they're amongst our most backlinked pages, so they're getting hundreds of thousands of-- on top of hundreds of thousands of backlinks from very low quality, more spammy type of sites from the people who put the links in the user profiles clearly buying the links or something so  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=960) |  is that something to be worried about?

Should I disavow those links? Should I just leave them? JOHN MULLER: I don't think you really need to do anything there. If you no-index those profile pages, in the end, then that all kind of disappears anyway. But that's a really popular tactic, and a lot of times, that's just completely automated. People will drop links here, and they see they're not no-followed. Therefore, they'll start building links to those profile pages, and a lot of times, that's just some scripts that  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=990) |  keep running forever. I wouldn't say it's

something that you need to urgently worry about, because we see that all the time as well, and we can usually deal with that fairly well. AUDIENCE: So adding no-follow and no-index to those pages, I wouldn't then need to disavow the backlinks themselves. JOHN MULLER: No, no. AUDIENCE: And they will, if I no-index them, those backlinks should just disappear on their own over time? Or will they always be there?  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1020) |  JOHN MULLER: I imagine they will remain

for a while, even after they drop out of the index. But essentially, they wouldn't have any effect there. Especially if the pages are no-followed, then they essentially stay there, and they don't get forward to the rest of the site. And it's also something where I don't think you would be seeing any positive effect from those backlinks, so it's not that you have to worry about causing a problem by cleaning up the spam.  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1050) |  AUDIENCE: OK. Thank you. JOHN MULLER: Sounds

like a lot of work. AUDIENCE: Yeah. JOHN MULLER: Yeah, Baruch? AUDIENCE: A follow-up to that, because you also mentioned there were some low quality sites there are good. I don't know-- people have this whole DA thing and this thing. There are sites, low quality ones that you were mentioning in the Twitter feed, that are OK. Like startups for instance-- JOHN MULLER: Oh, OK. Oh, I see what you mean.  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1080) |  So if it's just random sites linking

to your site, yeah, that's usually less of a problem, yeah. So just because it's a site that is less known doesn't necessarily mean that it's a problematic site. But in the case of these kind of profile links, that's something where these automated tools essentially build link networks across all of these user generated websites and try to promote their stuff that way. And that's something where I'd say,  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1110) |  it's not low quality links. It's just

pure spam that we can essentially ignore. AUDIENCE: But in her case, if she wants to really clean it up, she can build an AI tool and then filter out the illicit words or give away [INAUDIBLE] maybe to users or [INAUDIBLE]. JOHN MULLER: I think it's possible to do a lot of things, but probably just taking a really rough approach  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1140) |  and using something really simple, like has

this user contributed multiple times to the forum over a course of a couple of months-- that automatically catches all of those really basic spam bots. So that's something where I don't think you need to do anything really fancy, magical. It's something that's probably fairly easy to implement. AUDIENCE: So moving forward, disavowing-- pretty much that's it.  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1170) |  There's no need because your algorithm just

is very good at it. JOHN MULLER: I think, for these kind of things, I definitely wouldn't worry about disavow because these are all similarly perfected user generated content sites, and that's something we've seen since-- I don't know-- before I joined Google, those bots have been around, those scripts have been around, dropping links in forums and profile pages.  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1200) |  We have a lot of practice with

that. But it's something where we can try to get it as much as possible, but if you can take care of it by cleaning it up on your side and preventing it in the first place, that's always a much better solution. AUDIENCE: So, John, follow up on the backlink quality things-- we know that, if there's a page that's higher authority than have a lot of backlink to link that page, and data link to my website pages,  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1230) |  they will pass the link [INAUDIBLE] page

authority. So my question here is that, you know how page link work is largely based on what those source pages backlink, that page passing link [INAUDIBLE] to me. But in the situation that, let's say, there's a page that say the other website, and they have very great content, and they write--  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1260) |  for example, they talk about breast cancer

and write very good content about that, they have zero backlink, and they rank very well, perform very well. And that page linked to my article about breast cancer, too, so it's very semantically related. And they rank very well, perform very well, but they don't have any backlink. Would that link benefit my page? JOHN MULLER: I think if people are linking naturally  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1290) |  to your site, then I wouldn't worry

about if they benefit your page or not. If people are recommending your site as a good resource, that's always a good thing, so I wouldn't worry too much about if-- how much value I'm getting out of this random link that someone has added because you can't really control that yourself anyway. AUDIENCE: Yeah, I [INAUDIBLE] was saying,  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1320) |  what I want to actually ask about

[INAUDIBLE] is that we know that battling this highly [INAUDIBLE] on the source pages backlink, but do source pages' content also participate in the [INAUDIBLE] of the backlink quality? JOHN MULLER: I don't quite follow. [INAUDIBLE] you mean. AUDIENCE: So we know that backlink is [INAUDIBLE] when the source page have backlink. We all know that.  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1350) |  But does the source page quality also

play a role here? JOHN MULLER: I think that always plays a little bit of a role. I think it's very easy to try to isolate links and just focus on page rank and things like that, but page rank is just one really small part of the bigger Google algorithm. And when we see recommendations from other websites, we try to understand what that recommendation means. How is that website interacting with the rest of the web?  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1380) |  What are the anchor texts involved? What

is the text around those links? All of that plays a little bit of role with regards to understanding how this page should be treated. So it's something where it's easy to go in and say, well, this link counts so much page rank, and that's what I want. But there's always just so much more than just pure page rank out there. AUDIENCE: I see.  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1410) |  Thank you so much. JOHN MULLER: Sure.

Let me run through some of the submitted questions so that we don't lose track of them completely. It's totally awesome to see so many active people here in the hangout, though. Let's see-- "is there any impact on COVID-19 on the visibility in event scheme average results? We have an event discovery platform. We've been getting consistent visibility for our events and rich results for many years.  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1440) |  In March, it suddenly went to near

zero. We were not able to correlate this with any Google public announcements. Tried to post on Webmaster forum, but that hasn't helped." So I'm not 100% sure if we made any changes with regards to events, but I have heard something similar from other folks as well. AUDIENCE: Hi, John. I'm here. We are [INAUDIBLE].  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1470) |  JOHN MULLER: Oh, OK. AUDIENCE: How are

you? JOHN MULLER: OK, your question. Awesome. So I'm not 100% sure if anything particular happened there, but I have heard something similar from [INAUDIBLE].. AUDIENCE: We have implement online [INAUDIBLE] changes [INAUDIBLE] rate-- I mean, schemas [INAUDIBLE]. But I don't think there's, in fact, broadly, like this.  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1500) |  Consistently we got one link or a

one point-- I mean, more than one link with [INAUDIBLE] through event [INAUDIBLE]. So my question is, this happen, and suddenly. Is there any reason or something else? JOHN MULLER: My feeling is we shifted essentially most events over to kind of be online events,  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1530) |  and that's something that we started doing

a little bit more, but I don't know what the general plans are here or if this is something that might be different from region to region. It's really hard to say. AUDIENCE: I tried for open events schema as results and typed my, you know, brand [INAUDIBLE] events. So still my events are not showing there. So is there any blocking from your side?  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1560) |  JOHN MULLER: I don't know if we

have anything specific kind of holding back events at the moment. My feeling is that it's something that we're essentially trying to do organically now, but I don't know if there's anything specific happening there. I haven't heard from other people who run events with regards to event markup  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1590) |  recently about this. So it's hard to

say. But I think in the webmaster forum, you also included your sites URL. Is that correct? AUDIENCE: Yes, and my second question is, I ask in the webmaster forum. So some experts suggest me workshop events are not actually events. It is business promotion. So is this correct or not, workshop?  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1620) |  JOHN MULLER: Workshop? I don't know, depending

on how you frame it. I do see sometimes that people frame things as events that are not actually events. If it's something, for instance, like in an online course that you have or a sale that is currently taking place, then that's something we wouldn't see as an event. AUDIENCE: This type of workshop, we already  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1650) |  marked as a [INAUDIBLE] robots and noindex

nofollow. JOHN MULLER: OK. AUDIENCE: Still I will question if there is any genuine work. So still this workshop will count as a promotion or something like that. JOHN MULLER: If it's blocked by robots.txt or noindex, then we wouldn't index it. So I would-- AUDIENCE: No, no, no, my question is, low quality workshop are a noindex by our site,  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QPh3T7oemxM/hq2.jpg)



#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1680) |  but quality workshop are counted as promotions

or not? JOHN MULLER: I think it depends on how you frame the workshop. I don't think, like, I-- AUDIENCE: Because every-- yeah, because every competitor are using this workshop event [INAUDIBLE] ten times, everyone. JOHN MULLER: Yeah, so I would not focus on what the competitors are doing, and just because--  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1710) |  especially if you know that this is

something that you shouldn't be doing, then I wouldn't just copy what the competitors are doing because it's essentially not really going to help your website in the long run. AUDIENCE: No. I just ask you, everybody is doing workshop and this kind of stuff. JOHN MULLER: Yeah. AUDIENCE: That's right. JOHN MULLER: Yeah, OK, cool. I think for these kind of questions, we're not sure if this is the right markup for that, then that's something I would definitely  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1740) |  post in the webmaster help forum because

the folks there have seen a lot of kind of edge cases where they realize this is maybe problematic, maybe not problematic. AUDIENCE: So what's your suggestion? What can I do for getting my traffic back? JOHN MULLER: I think getting your traffic back, it seems like a different question than the kind of rich results in the search. If you're talking about getting traffic or rankings back,  

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1770) |  then that feels like something where you'd

need to work on the website overall rather than just focusing on the rich results site. AUDIENCE: OK, thank you so much. JOHN MULLER: Sure. AUDIENCE: Yeah. JOHN MULLER: OK, "We added the no sitelinks search box tag on our home page for over two months, but we still see the site links search box in the search results. What's up with that?" I don't know. If you can send me the URL, either dropping it  

#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1800) |  as a comment in the YouTube comments

there or send me a note on Twitter, I'm happy to take a look at that with the team. Usually, the sitelinks search box settings do take a little bit longer to be updated, but over two months seems a little bit long. "We're planning to launch a microsite. Which do you prefer, a subdomain or a subdirectory? If you say subdomain, should I have to create a separate site  

#### [0:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1830) |  map, or can I use the same

site map of the main domain? And, finally, what are some things to be considered when creating a microsite?" So from our point of view, you can use either a subdomain or subdirectory. I realize there is a lot of contention in the SEO sphere here about subdirectories and subdomains. But, essentially, either one of those would work from our side. I think, in practice, I would try  

#### [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1860) |  to use a subdirectory for this kind

of thing because it sounds like you're trying to create a new view of your existing content. It's not that you're trying to create something completely separate, but, essentially, it's like a landing page or maybe a handful of landing pages that are connected for a specific product that you're already selling or a service that you're providing on your main domain already. Then I will just try to tie that in with your main website. The advantages that you have there is that from a technical point of view,  

#### [0:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1890) |  everything is a lot easier. You can

use your CMS and just create a bunch of subdirectories and pages, and you're done. Whereas if you create a subdomain, then you suddenly have a separate hostname that you have to maintain or you have to watch out for things like redirects. You have to verify it separately in Search Console if you're not doing domain verification. You have to watch out for site map files. All of these kind of extra hassles that are involved with a subdomain, if you're essentially creating something that's essentially  

#### [0:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1920) |  a part of your main domain. If

this is something that's completely separate from your main domain, then maybe a subdomain is a good approach. Maybe even a separate domain is a good approach. Maybe still a subdirectory is also fine. But like the way you frame it here as a microsite for something that probably you were already doing in some way, I would definitely go for a subdirectory and keep it as easy as possible. Make it easy for you to maintain.  

#### [0:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1950) |  Make it easy for you to migrate

should you need to make changes over time. That's kind of what I would focus on there. AUDIENCE: John, I have a follow up on that if you have time for it. JOHN MULLER: Sure. AUDIENCE: So, like, where would you draw the line between something that is separate from the main site, something that is still similar to the main site, like, if I'm doing the same thing, but I'm-- so this is for publishing. So if I'm doing the same thing, I'm just publishing more articles, but it  

#### [0:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=1980) |  is on a topic that may not

be the-- it's like related, but it's not quite the same thing. And I'm thinking maybe there would be different audiences for the new thing than for the existing content, like, is that kind of where I should do a subdomain instead of a subdirectory? JOHN MULLER: Yeah, I think the situation that you mentioned in the beginning  

#### [0:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2010) |  where you had a forum and kind

of the main website, I think that's a perfect situation for something like a subdomain because those are clearly kind of separate entities or separate items that you're kind of maintaining. The people going to the forum might not be the ones that go to your main site, and, similarly, the ones going to your main site might not be the ones that would go to your forum as well. So that's kind of, I think, an optimal situation for something like a subdomain.  

#### [0:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2040) |  Also, from a technical point of view,

it's a lot easier to maintain because they're completely separate back ends involved, all of that. If you're just publishing content, I think for the most part, I would just keep it on the main domain. If it's just informational content, I try to keep it as simple as possible. If you have things like, I don't know, consumer facing side of an e-commerce site and then a dealer login, maybe that dealer login section  

#### [0:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2070) |  would be a separate login, or a

separate subdomain. But even there, sometimes from a content point of view, it makes sense to keep it all on one site, but, yeah, so I think if it's really just about different types of content and not different functionality, I'd try to keep it together on one site. AUDIENCE: OK, like, even if I have like sports and then, I don't know, politics, like, it would be--  

#### [0:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2100) |  you know, like, it would still be

OK to have one site. JOHN MULLER: Yeah. I think that still makes sense because then you can build up that combined site overall over time and that kind of gains value as a bigger group. Whereas if you split things up into subdomains, then you have these small islands that are somewhat connected, but more loosely connected rather than tightly connected to your main site.  

#### [0:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2130) |  AUDIENCE: OK, I'm asking this because I

read "How Google News Works" document, and there was a line in there about the audience and how an audience that turns to the site for one topic, that could pass off like an authority signal for that site like, I guess, being authoritative or being an expert in that topic because so much of the users who are interested in that topic, I guess, rely on the site or trust the site.  

#### [0:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2160) |  So that's kind of where I'm getting

like if the audiences-- if I'm publishing a lot of different topics on one big site, and I have kind of audiences very fragmented, like, is that something that could maybe disadvantage my site overall? JOHN MULLER: So I don't know about Google News. I don't know if they do something special there. But in general, from a web search point of view, I don't see a big problem there. The one place where I would watch out  

#### [0:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2190) |  for this is if you have a

mix of adult content and kind of general content, then that's something where a safe search algorithms might have trouble understanding where the separation is and then putting it on a separate subdomain makes it a lot easier to say, this is the content that can be filtered by safe search, and this is the general content. That's a lot easier. But kind of different themes like sports and politics, I don't think, for the most part, it would make sense to separate that out into two separate subdomains.  

#### [0:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2220) |  AUDIENCE: OK, perfect, thank you. AUDIENCE: John,

can I ask another question right quick? JOHN MULLER: Sure. AUDIENCE: All right, so another follow up on about these safe search parts. Let's say in a case that you have [INAUDIBLE],, that you get a lot of spammy links using porn-related anchor text. And you're seeing some scenario that people are actually coming to our sites and writing down on a comment section, you know, adult words, and they're also  

#### [0:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2250) |  sending links using, you know. Is there

any way that's going to harm us [INAUDIBLE]?? Because we know, you know, based on documents, SafeSearch filter is supposed to be on URL basis, but are they, sort of, I don't know, domain-wide algorithms that might affect with all sites? JOHN MULLER: Now, so in particular, when it comes to things like SafeSearch,  

#### [0:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2280) |  we try to be as fine grained

as possible with the way that we deal with this. But it's not always possible, so it's something where if we can't isolate the part of the site fairly easily automatically, then we quickly end up in a situation where we say, well, SafeSearch applies to the whole domain. So that's something I would definitely watch out for. With regards to people writing things as comments on your website, keep in mind  

#### [0:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2310) |  we do try to understand which parts

of the website have comments and which parts of the pages have comments and try to understand that. But, ultimately, the content that you're publishing includes these comments. So if you don't want your website to be found for things like that, or if you don't think that these comments are providing value to your website, then that's something I would take action on because, ultimately, it's your website, and if other people are contributing content to your website, and you're saying,  

#### [0:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2340) |  oh, this is fine, then you will

have to kind of live with a situation that search engines think, well, this is a part of what you want to stand for on the web, and maybe we will send you traffic for these comments, or maybe we will look at this content and say, oh, this is kind of gibberish. We don't know what to do with this website overall. So that's something where I wouldn't completely ignore random user-generated content on your website, kind of the comments  

#### [0:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2370) |  that you get like that. Obviously, it's

hard to draw a line and say, well, I would approve manually every comment that is made on a website. If you have tons of comments, then that's essentially impossible to do. But you can kind of work to figure out what kind of comments are useful, maybe let users flag comments so that you can manually review those or maybe have something like a bad word list that you try to use in a simple way to figure out,  

#### [0:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2400) |  are these comments actually useful, or is

this maybe something I don't want to have published on my site? AUDIENCE: Will noindex work in this case, the noindex of those pages? [INAUDIBLE]? JOHN MULLER: Sure. I mean, if you noindex those pages, that's kind of a big hammer because then the whole page is gone. But if it's no index, then we don't use that for indexing. AUDIENCE: Thank you. JOHN MULLER: Sure.  

#### [0:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2430) |  OK, some more questions. "Most of the

important questions answered by Matt are a decade old, and a lot has changed since then. Is it possible to have them answered again?" Sure. I mean, we've been recording lots and lots of videos, so I'm happy to answer more questions, but let us know what kind of videos you would think would profit from a modern take because we have gone through a lot of those older videos from Matt,  

#### [0:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2460) |  and a lot of the things, they

still stand. There are lots of timeless answers there with regards to how you can improve things for your website, particularly around search. And a lot of these things don't change that much over time. So just because something is old isn't really a reason for us to say, we need to delete it and do it again because it's like having a fresh face on a video makes things so much better.  

#### [0:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2490) |  I think Matt did a fantastic job

with a lot of these videos. But like I said, if you run across anything that you think definitely need to be replaced or definitely need to be taken down because they are no longer relevant, by all means let us know. "Are rich results from the structured data markup always on the first page of the search results, or can they be shown beyond the first page?" They can definitely be shown beyond the first page. That's something that's not tied to the first page of the search  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QPh3T7oemxM/hq3.jpg)



#### [0:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2520) |  results. Some particular kinds of elements in

the search results are sometimes more visible on the first page, but they're, like, all the different rich results types, as far as I know, can be shown on any page in the search results. AUDIENCE: Hey, hey, John, follow up on that. That's my question. So a lot of time I see that there is-- we go to a GSC, Google Search Console, they have-- I see something like they have rich results, but that's in ,  

#### [0:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2550) |  like, 50 position or something. But they

have very high impressions, like, the impression looks like it's on the first page. So what that mean in GSC? JOHN MULLER: I think that's really confusing sometimes, and I don't know what it means in your particular case, but the tricky part with the search results page is it's not just like those 10 links below each other anymore.  

#### [0:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2580) |  We have all of those one boxes

and sidebars and different navigational elements on a page, where it's easy possible that you have maybe 20, 30, maybe even some pages, 50 links, that are shown on one search results page. And they will all see impressions. They will have kind of the position number in Search Console, and that can sometimes look a little bit confusing.  

#### [0:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2610) |  So sometimes we see it that it

looks like something is on the first page, even though its position, I don't know, 20 or 30 or 40. Sometimes we see things that we say, oh, this is position number 2, and you look at the page, and it's, like, where's my website? It's not showing up at all, and it ends up being maybe one of those images in a thumbnail on top, which for a webmaster is, like, well, technically it's a link to my website. But, practically, it's not as visible as a big text log.  

#### [0:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2640) |  So it's sometimes tricky to-- I guess

to, uh, understand what is shown in that search performance report, and this is something where you also see differences across different kind of ranking checking tools, if you use anything like that, because everyone has a different opinion on how you should count the position on a page. And I don't know what the final answer there will be,  

#### [0:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2670) |  but it's also something that we we're

looking at from time to time to see how can we make that position number a little bit more useful for people so that they understand what does this number actually mean? Is my site, like, visible? Is it very visible or just slightly visible on a page? It's sometimes hard to judge. AUDIENCE: Thank you so much, John. AUDIENCE: Do you know if-- so sometimes, there's a knowledge panel on the top of the-- I'm talking about mobile search results  

#### [0:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2700) |  where you kind of go through tabs

to access the content. And sometimes you, lets say, flip to a news tab or interesting finds or something, and then there's a Load More. So if you only rank after you hit the Load More, does that still count as average position 1 or whatever the actual knowledge panel's position is in Search Console? JOHN MULLER: That's only counted when people see your site in the search results. So it's, well, not when they see your site,  

#### [0:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2730) |  but rather when your site is loaded

with a link in that search results page. So if you have to click the Load More button in order for kind of the next part of the links to be shown, then that wouldn't count as the first page. That would only count when someone actually clicks on that. AUDIENCE: OK, so the position would be much lower or would it not? How would that appear, I guess? JOHN MULLER: It would be higher. It's kind of like going to page 2. AUDIENCE: OK. AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.  

#### [0:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2760) |  JOHN MULLER: "What are the recommendations from

Google for indexing, and ranking audio? Nowadays, some publishers produce audio, just have two main ways to index and rank this content, Google Podcasts, or embedded in a news article surrounded by text. What are some options? Are there any plans to give more visibility to audio in the search results?" So I can't say much about the plans. On the one hand, I'm not aware of anything specific being  

#### [0:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2790) |  planned there, but we also generally try

not to preannounce things. With regards to audio in general, I think the best approach is really just to work with transcripts and to, especially if you're doing something like a podcast where people are talking, then if you have a transcript, then that's something we can look at and see from a web search point of view. Here's a bunch of text. We can rank this page based on this text. So that's kind of the main approach I would take there.  

#### [0:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2820) |  It's something where I imagine at some

point in the future we'll be able to go in there and do kind of voice understanding of what is being said and index the audio content based on that, but I don't think that will happen within the next couple of weeks or anything like that. So making sure you have a transcript, text together with the links to your audio files, that's probably what I would aim for.  

#### [0:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2850) |  "The Structured Data Testing Tool will be

greatly missed. Are there any plans to expand the scope of the Rich Results Testing Tool?" Yeah, I know. Lots of people have been very vocal about wanting the Structured Data Testing Tool to remain. I think it's something from a technical point of view, it makes sense for the team to focus on one tool rather than two tools, and one of the pieces of feedback  

#### [0:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2880) |  we've received with structured data in general

is that it's sometimes hard for people to understand which types of structured data actually have an effect in search, and that's why we focus on the Rich Results Tool, which focuses on the things that we would show as Google in the search results. So that's kind of the background there. We are planning on expanding the Rich Results Testing Tool. We've been looking at all the feedback that we're getting where people are, like, oh, this is, like, terrible, Google because this one use case  

#### [0:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2910) |  I have only works in the Structured

Data Testing Tool, and we try to take that kind of feedback, understand what it is that people are trying to do and to make sure that we can implement that with the Rich Results Testing Tool. Also, the Structured Data Testing Tool is not going away, like, just now. So it's not that you urgently have to jump over, but by all means, make sure to send us feedback. If there's something specific that you will miss if the Structured Data Testing Tool goes away  

#### [0:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2940) |  and try to make that feedback as

actionable and as understandable as possible. Sometimes we just get feedback just, like, oh, Google, you're terrible. It's, like, you shouldn't do this and take away our toys. But you don't tell us what we should change, and we can't really work with that kind of feedback. So make sure that the feedback is something that we can take to the team and say, look, look at this smart person here with this smart piece of feedback  

#### [0:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=2970) |  about their specific use case. It makes

total sense. We should make sure that this works. So that's kind of what we would like. AUDIENCE: Hey, a follow up on the [INAUDIBLE] schema that Google uses, some schema they don't. So we know that a lot of the SEO skill set suggestion to use organization markup, but I know it is not in the [INAUDIBLE] it's in the development guide. So is Google's actually use it, or is there any benefit? And, also, generally, if there is some schema markup,  

#### [0:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=3000) |  schema.org website, but it's not listing the

Google Developer guide, can I be benefiting in any way in SEO specifically? JOHN MULLER: Yeah, that's, I think, one of the trickier questions with regards to all of the structure data in that we have a lot of things that we use to try to understand a page and the content on the page that we don't necessarily show directly in the search results. So in the rich results tests, we focus  

#### [0:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=3030) |  on the things that actually have direct

visible effects or can have direct visible effects, but a lot of things help us to better understand the content and the context of a particular page. And those are things within kind of like a general schema.org markup, which you can do various things, and that's kind of, I'd say, almost a shame that we don't highlight that in the rich results test. But it's also something where it's very easy to go overboard  

#### [0:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=3060) |  because there are just so many different

things you can mark up with schema.org, and you can spend a lot of time marking up all of those individual elements, and there's absolutely zero effect on your search results, even if we were to process that. So if there are things where you feel we desperately need to understand the relationships of the items on your page it's a little bit better, then go ahead and add that markup to the page.  

#### [0:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=3090) |  But if it's just, like, oh, there

are five different types of schema.org that could apply to this page, therefore, I'll mark it up, that's probably not providing any value. So the really common use case is to mark a page as a web page. Like, we do that on the google.com homepage as well. So it's not, like, us making fun of everyone else, but it's something where, as a search engine, you look at that web page, and it's, like, it's a web page, and it says it's a web page.  

#### [0:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=3120) |  What else could it be? It doesn't

give us any extra value. So finding things that are really high level, important for your pages and adding the markup for that, even if it's not visible, I think that's perfectly fine. Going overboard and just adding all types of markup that you can find, like, it's not going to harm your site, but it's kind of a waste of time. AUDIENCE: OK, thank you so much. JOHN MULLER: Sure. AUDIENCE: Hey, John, I have a quick mobile-first,  

#### [0:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=3150) |  indexing-related question for you if you've got

a moment. So I manage a lot of sites. They're in the mobile-first index, and, generally, they get crawled about 90% mobile, maybe 10% desktop crawler. One of the sites-- and, again, it's an adaptive platform rather than fully responsive, so there are some differences. I have one site in particular, it's my larger sites, that's getting crawled at about 40% desktop, 60% mobile.  

#### [0:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=3180) |  Does that create problems? Again, it is

in the mobile-first index. Is that a bad thing? Is that something I should be working to fix? Can you explain a little bit about that? JOHN MULLER: I don't think that would be a sign of a bad thing. My hunch is that it depends a little bit

have on the site. So, for example, I'm not sure if for Google Shopping, we would use the smartphone googlebot, or if we'd use a desktop googlebot, So if it's an e-commerce site that's visible in Google Shopping, and we crawl kind of shopping results with the desktop googlebot, then you'll probably see more crawls with the desktop googlebot in a case like that. I'm not 100% sure if that's the case with shopping.

of the ads bot, the landing page check, those kind of things. But depending on the type of content, we might be using slightly different requests on our side to crawl the site. And that could result in a slightly different skew of desktop versus mobile when it comes to the overall crawling when you look at your log files. AUDIENCE: Cool. Thank you. AUDIENCE: Follow up on e-commerce, very good. Just so Martin-- a while ago, Martin

render JavaScript. So in that case, if I switch my product page schema markup-- schema-based JavaScript, will it still be able to show up in rich results in shopping-related term? JOHN MULLER: I don't know. I don't know what specifically Martin said there. I would check with Martin, especially when it comes to rendering, he knows everything there. AUDIENCE: I see. Since I already asked him, but he don't know anything

Oh, OK, yeah. So I think everything around shopping is something that is kind of sneaking up on us on the web search side because a lot of the shopping things are now kind of being merged a little bit within the organic search results, and they're no longer kind of this separate paid experience. So I imagine, over time, we'll have a little bit more information to share around that. AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.  

#### [0:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPh3T7oemxM&t=3330) |  JOHN MULLER: Cool. OK, we didn't get

through, like, a ton of questions, but if there's anything in the questions that you really need to have answered, feel free to drop that into the next Hangout. I need to jump off to another meeting. So I can't stick around a little bit longer, but, maybe on Friday, we'll have a bit more time. Thank you all for joining in. Thanks for all of the fantastic questions from you all. I hope you found this useful, and, hopefully, we'll see each other again in one of the future Hangouts.

Bye. AUDIENCE: Thank you. AUDIENCE: Thanks.
