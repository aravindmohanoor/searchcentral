that all events are canceled this year. MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah, we can't have local Webmaster Conferences right now. But what about a virtual conference instead? AURORA MORALES: Oh, I like those. We can join from any part of the globe at any time of the day. But yet another online conference? MARTIN SPLITT: Mmm, yes, but no. What if we made a Virtual Webmaster Unconference?

how would that work? MARTIN SPLITT: You know, instead of just listening to speakers giving presentations, we have a few Googlers in the community propose topics for discussions that then everyone attending the event can vote on. And then they participate in the discussions which have received the most votes. AURORA MORALES: So no presentations? MARTIN SPLITT: Correct. It will be a series of interactive discussions. AURORA MORALES: That sounds amazing.
