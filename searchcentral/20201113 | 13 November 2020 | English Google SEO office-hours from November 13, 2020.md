Feel free to join us - we welcome webmasters of all levels!



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=0) |  JOHN MUELLER: All right. Welcome, everyone, to

the first Google Search Central Office Hours Hangout. My name is John Muller. I'm a Search Advocate here at Google in Switzerland. And part of what we do are these Office Hour Hangouts, where people can jump in and ask questions about their website and web search. This is the first Google Search Central Hangout. But essentially it's the same as the previous Hangouts  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=30) |  that we've been doing. The name has

changed slightly because we kind of rebranded everything. So that's been pretty exciting this week. A bunch of stuff has been submitted already. But if any of you want to get started with the first question, you're welcome to jump in. SAIDUL HOQUE: Hello, John. JOHN MUELLER: Go for it. SAIDUL HOQUE: Hi. John, I have one for our client.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=60) |  They had to supplement a website. So

one of the website they actually designed for targeting Melbourne audience. And another one they are targeting for Western Australia [? Estate. ?] Now, they have planned to get rid of their second brand, which they use for the Western Australia. And they want to use Melbourne brand for entire Australia. And they want to [INAUDIBLE] whole brand. Now, the website they have for the Western Australia, that  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=90) |  want to remove the website. And we

are thinking whether we should use 301 redirection or [INAUDIBLE] so that we can still get the ranking of the Western Australia website to the Melbourne website. JOHN MUELLER: I think that's kind of up to you, depending on what you want to do there specifically. So with a 301 redirect, you're essentially saying, we're combining these websites.  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=120) |  And with the [INAUDIBLE] canonical, you're kind

of able to leave the old website where it is and kind of focus your energy on the new one. And leaving the old website where it is might make sense if you want to keep it for other reasons, other than SEO, for example. So that's usually the two aspects that I would look at there. So if you're purely thinking about SEO and you just want to combine everything and clean everything up, I would redirect and do a proper merger  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=150) |  between those sites. But if you want

to keep the old website alive for whatever reasons, then canonical is a good approach. SAIDUL HOQUE: Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. MIHAI APERGHIS: John, I'm curious about something regarding-- actually, regarding Google News, because there are so many surfaces out there.  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=180) |  You have the Top Stories. You have

the News tab in Google Search. And you have the Google News app, I guess, or different surface. So are they all operating under different kind of algorithms, decisions? Does each surface-- because we've noticed we've been working with the publisher and they seem to be doing very well in Top Stories and the News tab in Google Search. But when you search for the exact same query  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=210) |  in Google News, they're not being shown

almost at all. You can see them. And you can see their articles if you go to their news source. But you cannot-- they're not being shown for regular queries, whereas for the Top Stories or the News tab they show up fairly well. JOHN MUELLER: I don't know all of the details around Google News. So that's kind of the one aspect there. But for Top Stories and kind of the News tab  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=240) |  in Search, from our point of view,

those are essentially just specific variations of search. So that's something where any website could appear. It doesn't necessarily need to be a news website. It doesn't necessarily need to be listed in Google News. So those are essentially just kind of variations of search. And for these different variations, because we think the intent is slightly different, there are definitely different kind of ranking algorithms  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=270) |  at play there. And I assume in

Google News, they have a whole set of their own ranking algorithms that they use for kind of that part. But no, I think it's getting more and more complicated because of all of these different surfaces. And there's also Discover. That kind of plays in there as well, which makes it a little bit harder than before,  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=300) |  where you could just say, oh, I'm

in Google News and I focused on this. And I'm also in web search and I see myself here. But on the other hand, it also keeps it a little bit exciting, because you have more opportunities, more different ways to appear, and more things that you could be focusing on slightly differently than your competitors could be focusing on. MIHAI APERGHIS: Right. I don't see this as a problem, having multiple services and each one has that--  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=330) |  makes its own decisions in terms of

what they should show or not. I'm just worrying about, there's a big discrepancy when on a few surfaces, everything seems to be OK. And on another one, the site doesn't show up at all. So it's kind of hard to diagnose, OK, why? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I don't really have any great answers for that. And I think it's also tricky because we  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=360) |  don't show all of those details in

Search Console where it's kind of harder to kind of see exactly what is happening where. MIHAI APERGHIS: OK. They do have a support team, but unfortunately they are not very helpful. JOHN MUELLER: OK, now that's unfortunate. MIHAI APERGHIS: Do you know if there are any office hours? I'm not sure if-- JOHN MUELLER: I don't think so. No. MIHAI APERGHIS: OK. So the support, you know, form is probably the only avenue.  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=390) |  JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. That's usually the best

approach. And every time I try to escalate News issues internally, they're always like, tell them to use the forum. MIHAI APERGHIS: OK. JOY F: Hi, John. Can I follow up on that really quickly? JOHN MUELLER: Sure. JOY F: So speaking specifically to the News tab in Search, if I'm at a site and I search for my site specifically and I'm seeing the articles being listed not  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=420) |  in chronological order, is there something I

should be worried about with that? For other competitors, I see that theirs are showing, at least correctly in my view. But from what I'm seeing, I'll see something three weeks ago versus seeing something 20 minutes ago. That's something concerning I should kind of look into? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. I actually don't know if they're supposed to be in chronological order, or if that's  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=450) |  just how they sometimes end up. One

thing you could do is try to double check that we can recognize the date of your pages properly. One way you can kind of guess at that is if we show a date and a snippet, then that gives you a bit of an idea. Another thing you can do is use the date restrict in Google Search, where I think it's under Tools now, or in the Advanced Search settings, where you can specify a date range and just kind of roughly double check  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=480) |  that we're picking up the right dates

for your articles. One of the things I've noticed is that on some sites, the article date is kind of less prominent or less clear for us to understand. And we might pick up a date within the body of the article or from the sidebar somewhere instead. And we have a Help Center article on how to specify dates on your pages.  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=510) |  And the important part there is really

that all of these things align so that the visible date on the page matches the date that you have in the structured data. And if we can recognize the date properly, then usually we'll be able to pick that up accordingly. It's still sometimes the case that we have individual ones that are off, but essentially, if you're doing things right, if you're doing things in a consistent way, then at least we'd be able to pick up the date. And if we need to use the date to kind of show these articles  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=540) |  in chronological order in the News tab,

then at least we'd be able to do that. But like I said, I don't know if they're supposed to be in chronological order. I would assume that it's not necessarily always the case, similar to in web search, where if you search for a website, sometimes we show the home page. Sometimes we don't show the home page as a first result. JOY F: OK, thank you.  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=570) |  JOHN MUELLER: OK. Let me run through

some of the submitted questions. And we'll definitely have time for more questions from you all later on. And if you have any comments or questions in between to the questions or answers, feel free to jump on in. "Do orphaned subpages"-- so subpages without internal links-- "with duplicated or low-quality content have negative impact for a website overall?" So I think--  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=600) |  I wasn't quite sure exactly which direction

this question goes to. So it's hard to say exactly what would be helpful for you in this particular case. In particular, if you have pages that don't have internal links pointing at them, so pages that are hard to find from crawling, then usually Google Search will assume that these are not very critical for your website, because you're essentially hiding away from people who are clicking around within your website.  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=630) |  And if we assume that you think

they're not very critical for your website, then probably we won't give them as much weight in Search. And if we don't give them as much weight in Search, then it doesn't really matter that much what you actually have on those pages. So that's kind of the one aspect there. If you have pages within your site that you're not linking to at all, then we don't really know what you want to tell us with that.  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=660) |  And if those pages are duplicate or

low-quality content and we don't give them much weight, then it doesn't really matter that much. On the other hand, if you want those pages to be findable in search, then I would definitely make sure that you do have internal links pointing at them and that you do try to avoid duplicate and low-quality content on those pages. So those are kind of the two aspects that I would look at there.  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=690) |  "In Search Console, I'm seeing CLS issue

more than 0.25 on mobile. How does this affect the SEO, even if it's not affecting user experience?" Good question. So I think-- so CLS is a metric from the Core Web Vitals Cumulative Layout Shift, I believe, which is basically a measurement for how much of a page shifts when a page is loaded. So if you open a page and then, while it's loading,  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=720) |  a new image pops up on top

and everything shifts down, then it's hard to actually read the content on that page. So that, from our point of view, is a usability issue. We introduced the Core Web Vitals earlier this year. And our plan is to start using them as a part of the page experience factor for ranking in Search, I think, in May next year, I think we announced.  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=750) |  So at the moment, that's not something

that would be affecting your SEO. In May, that might be affecting your SEO, because if you're not reaching kind of that good bar with regards to the Core Web Vitals, then that's something that could have a negative effect on your site's ranking. Yeah, so my recommendation there would be to try to figure out where that's coming from and to try to find ways to improve that so that you're a little bit ahead of the curve and don't have to rush anything  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=780) |  when it comes to May. With regards

to testing these things, one of the aspects to keep in mind-- in Search Console, the data that we show is based on data that users have seen. So we call it real user metrics. And this is aggregated over the course of a month. And it's based on what users see with their connections to your website. So in particular, if you're testing this then locally to try to reproduce this, and you're saying,  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=810) |  well, it works for me, it's important

to keep in mind that your connection to your website might be very different from the average user's connection to your website. So if you're seeing very different metrics when you test it internally, then that's something where you might want to kind of figure out, well, why am I seeing this difference? What do I need to do so that I can better reproduce what my users would be seeing?  

#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=840) |  "Which is best, rel nofollow or rel

equals sponsored for outgoing affiliate links?" From our point of view, both of these are possible. So for affiliate links, we generally recommend specifying that these should not be passing page rank or any of the other search signals. And you can do that with rel equals nofollow or rel equals sponsored. You can also combine these. So in particular, some search engines  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=870) |  don't use rel sponsored yet. So you

could easily use rel nofollow sponsored on these outbound links and you're essentially covered. From our point of view, we prefer having a clearer specification with rel equals sponsored, but that's really just so that we understand your site a little bit better. It's not that there is a kind of a big SEO difference with regards to handling them with nofollow or with sponsored. Also for the more common kinds of affiliate links,

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=900) |  we've generally seen a lot of those

already for a longer time. So we're able to handle those ourselves. It's not the case that you'll have any kind of automatic penalty or any other search issues if you don't clearly specify your affiliate links. It just helps us because you're kind of being a little bit more deliberate on saying, well, these links, I don't need you to pass any signals to.  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=930) |  "Two questions-- why does the organic click-through

rate drop with the exact same ranking for two different time periods? This is a pattern we've started seeing with some of our keywords." Yeah, I don't think there's any particular reason from our side why the click-through rate would be dropping if nothing else is changing in the search results, but rather that sounds more like, well, things are changing for the users.  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=960) |  And that could be because maybe your

snippet or your title isn't as clear to users or doesn't match what they were looking for. It could be that users are just searching for different kinds of content. It might be that people are searching more or people are searching less for those particular queries. These are essentially changes more on the user side than on Google's side, because if we show your result in the same position for these searches, then essentially, potentially, you  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=990) |  could be getting the same click-through rate.

But what users actually do is not something we can control. It's more up to the user. And oftentimes, click-through rate is something that you can slightly affect by working with your titles or your descriptions to make them a little bit clearer. The other thing to keep in mind is that click-through rate kind of as an aggregate metric for the whole website overall is probably not a great metric because many sites rank for things that are kind  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1020) |  of irrelevant for this site. And it

might be that you start ranking for something that is very visible, because a lot of people search for it. But they're definitely not searching for your particular site to get there. That's something we sometimes see with our documentation, for example. We've been going through a lot of our documentation to figure out what we should be watching out for as we did the big migration or started the migration.  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1050) |  And one of the things we notice

is sometimes our documentation ranks for things like video. And people searching for videos are definitely not looking for structured data markup that they can put on videos. They're probably looking for videos directly. And if we look at the overall click through rate of our site, then when people search for video and we show our structured data documentation there, then probably our click through rate really drops because it's like, lots of people are searching.  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1080) |  We're kind of ranking in the same

places. But we're showing in search results that are irrelevant for our sites that we don't really care about. And that would change the overall metrics. So if you're purely looking at the overall click through rate, then probably you're missing a lot of details that matter a little bit more. Then the second question is, "Google's domain or site diversity update launched during June, 2019.  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1110) |  And it doesn't seem to be working,

as we're continually seeing more than three to four results from the same site for a certain [INAUDIBLE] queries. Please shed some light on this." Oh no. I see people nodding. OK, so in general, we don't have a restriction on the number of times that a site can appear in search. And it can happen that a site appears once in a search result. It can happen that it appears 5, 6, 7--  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1140) |  more times, even-- in the same search

results page. And from our point of view, it's not a bug when a site appears more often. It's something that sometimes makes sense for users. The update that we did at that time is to try to reduce the number of times that we show sites multiple times in the same search results. But it's not to completely limit sites from appearing multiple times.  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1170) |  So from that point of view, it's

hard to say that this is not working or it is working, but rather, what would be useful there would be tax-specific examples. So if you're seeing things for kind of generic queries where you're seeing the same site appearing very often in the search results and there are very good other results that we should be showing instead, please send us some examples. So that's the best way to handle this on our side, especially if you have something that's really obvious where  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1200) |  if you're searching for kind of a

generic term and you find all of the whole page filled with the same site, and there is a lot of other good content for that available, then that's something we can pass on to the search quality team here. And usually they take these reports and they try to figure out, why is this happening? What can we do to improve it? And then what algorithmic changes could we launch in the future to help make these kind of search results a little bit better.  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1230) |  "Does Google have any"-- ROBB YOUNG: Is

there an example provided in the question, or-- JOHN MUELLER: No. It's like non-branded queries in the ed tech space. ROBB YOUNG: I only mention it because we see that-- I've seen that happening more now, similar to what happened four or five years ago. But I think we try and be honest with ourselves  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1260) |  and separate what is a brand and

what isn't, because you know our sites are experiencedays.com and experiencegifts.com. Now, those are brands, but they're also very generic terms, as well. So sometimes it's very difficult to determine whether or-- for Google to determine whether that's a brand search or whether that's just a generic search. But we have seen an uptick in those first pages having  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1290) |  four to six queries of the same

site. Sorry, results from the same site rather than what's been going on over the last three or four years. But it also goes in cycles, where every three or four years this looks like it happens, and it looks like you guys there are doing something and then go, oh, no, that didn't work, so that's [INAUDIBLE].. JOHN MUELLER: I think if you have any examples, send them  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1320) |  my way. I'm happy to pass them

on to our team. It's something where sometimes the examples that I see on Twitter are very kind of hand-picked. And as soon as you kind of vary the query slightly, you realize, well, actually, it's just one very specific case where that's happening. But I think, especially if you have a site that is kind of with a generic name or--  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1350) |  well, it's not very generic. I guess

people know you by now, right? ROBB YOUNG: But still, those two words also sum up our industry. People can be searching for our competitors, but they're looking for a driving experience day. And it's very difficult for you to determine whether they're looking for us or just what someone else sells that's similar to us. It's one of the things we have to cope with. But we get huge benefits from having that domain, as well. Not that an exact [? match ?] domain matters to anyone,  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1380) |  but we still do get some benefit.

So we're on the fence about it. There's no point us complaining, because we get the good and the bad. JOHN MUELLER: OK. So we'll have to wait for your competitors to send me an email. ROBB YOUNG: Right. JOHN MUELLER: OK, cool. If you find any bad examples, in that case, send them my way.  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1410) |  "Does Google have any special criteria for

search terms like "best" or "top"? For instance, might "best surgeon Beverly Hills" favor the site or page most optimized for the word or phrase "best," or are there other unique data sets used by Google for these particular queries, like number of Google reviews, stars, on page appearance, et cetera?" I don't know. This is an interesting question. My feeling is, from what I've seen,  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1440) |  that we do try to recognize these

particular kinds of queries and figure out what we should be showing there, rather than just purely focusing on the actual words in the query. So that's something that you also see with a lot of the "near me" type queries, where for a long time our algorithms were, I guess, more basic, in a sense, in the way that people would optimize  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1470) |  their site for "near me" queries, where

it would be like, "pizzeria near me" and you would have a page on your site that is called, like, "pizzeria near me," which isn't particularly useful if you're just in one location. But I have seen some sites kind of appear in the search results because of the things that they did there. And as far as I've seen, this is something that we've gotten better and better  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1500) |  at understanding and figuring out, OK, this

is actually the search query. And this is more of a qualifier that doesn't necessarily need to be on the page itself. And I assume something similar like that would apply for queries like "best" or "top," where we'd have to focus a little bit more on things that are outside of that page to figure out, is this really the best one to show? Or are people looking for a list of these particular kinds  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1530) |  of businesses to try to figure out

what we should be showing there? So that's something where I can't imagine that sometimes it's useful to include these kind of words on your site. But probably in the meantime, our algorithms are a little bit more focused on things that are outside of just purely matching those individual words. "If there's a huge website-- if a huge website updates all its data in a single day,  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1560) |  why isn't that data crawled? Is it

difficult for the crawler to go through it all at once?" Yes, it can be very difficult to crawl a huge website all at once. So that's definitely tricky. I think there are multiple things that come into play here. On the one hand, we'd have to recognize that a larger website is updating all at once, and based on that, then  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1590) |  try to figure out, how do we

schedule the re-crawling of all of these URLs? And that's something you can sometimes help with a sitemap file, to let us know that all of these URLs have changed and we should go up and try to refresh as much as possible of what we can do there. And in general, our crawling is split into two kind of general buckets, or maybe three,  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1620) |  I guess. On the one hand, we

want to discover new content on your website. We want to discover what is happening that is particularly new on your site. So we'll go off and crawl new things and things that we haven't seen before. And on the other hand, we'll also go off and try to update and refresh the crawls that we've done so far in the past, and try to figure out which of these pages have changed.  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1650) |  And balancing these two sides is sometimes

a bit tricky. So that's something where we have to figure out, how much do we need to spend on refreshing? How much do we have to spend on discovering new content? How much do we need to spend on things like the home page of a website so that we make sure that we don't miss anything along the way. And all of that kind of comes together in a general topic of crawl budget, in the sense that we kind of can figure out how much we want  

#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1680) |  to spend on each of these parts,

but how much can we actually crawl from your website without causing any problems? And crawl budget is something we've written a blog post about that, I think, a few years ago that primarily focuses on two aspects-- on the one hand, how much can your server kind of sustain? We don't want to cause any problems on your server. We want to make sure that users, when they go to your site, that they're not confronted with a severely  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1710) |  slowed down server, because search engines are

crawling all the time. So that's something we try to figure out automatically. And on the other hand, we need to balance the demand from our side, like how much we think we need to crawl from this website. And some of that comes from understanding how much we need to refresh. So essentially what happens with a larger website is, we'll try to refresh all of the data  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1740) |  that we have with the website within

over the course of maybe a month to three months to maybe six months. So that's kind of the general crawling that we do across a website. So if we don't have any other signals at all from a website, we'll probably have like somewhere between three months and six months time to refresh all of the content there. So that's kind of the general crawling.  

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1770) |  And you can imagine, if you update

the whole website on one day, then we'd have to do six months worth of crawling on one day to try to combine all of that and get that all kind of concentrated in one go. So usually, what happens when we recognize that a site does the larger scale updates is we'll try to refresh as much as possible as quickly as possible. So we'll try to get that in within a couple of days.  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VAg6CIUG3Kg/hq2.jpg)



#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1800) |  And essentially, we'll try to focus on

the most important pages first, so that pages that the users would end up seeing. Those are the ones that we try to refresh as quickly as possible. And then there's a whole bunch of other pages that also updated, but which we know they're very rarely shown in search. So we don't really need to refresh them all at once. So because of that, what you'll see with a larger website when you make a bigger change-- which could be something like a name change.  

#### [0:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1830) |  It could be a domain change. It

could be a change of titles or something like that. You'll see a bulk of the visible important pages get update fairly quickly, within a couple of days, and kind of this longer tail of other pages take a couple of months to be updated. So that's usually the approach that happens there, balancing all of those different parts. So unfortunately, we can't crawl the whole web at once every day.  

#### [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1860) |  MARC OPITZ: May raise a question here?

JOHN MUELLER: Sure. MARC OPITZ: There's an opportunity in the Google Search Console to let you know about a website has changed or updated or something like that. Forgot the name of that specific thingy. But it's been off for a couple of weeks now. And you mentioned on Twitter that this is just for fixing purposes or something like that. So my question would be, do you have any updates on when that project is going to be relaunched?  

#### [0:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1890) |  And the other question would be, would

you guys at Google think about bulk uploading? JOHN MUELLER: How do you mean bug uploading? MARC OPITZ: Currently it's only possible to give you one URL, to crawl that URL and send that for indexing. And frankly, when I have, like, 10, 20 websites that  

#### [0:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1920) |  are updated for some reason and I

have to type in every new URL alone. And then there is that capture I have to go through and several clicks to be made. And I think it's like, even if I had worked with several tabs, it's like 10 tabs is the max which is allowed or something. So a bulk upload function would be really, really helpful sometimes. JOHN MUELLER: Oh, bulk. Bulk uploading. OK. I misunderstood you. OK. Yeah.  

#### [0:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1950) |  I struggle with this, because my general

feeling is, if we have a way of sites to tell us that the pages have changed or that need to be updated, then we should try to find a way to automate that as much as possible. So instead of telling you that you need to go and kind of fill out this form or upload a special file with all of the URLs or something like that, and then go through the captchas and all of this,  

#### [0:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=1980) |  I think our system should be set

up in a way that they can automatically handle this. And we essentially have a system to do that, which is all of the sitemap stuff, where you can say, well, this page has changed and Google should refresh that as quickly as possible. And my general sense is that if you go to the effort and say, well, these 10, 20 pages have changed,  

#### [0:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2010) |  and I will even fill out a

captcha to prove it to you, then it feels like maybe we should find a way to trust your sitemap files a little bit better so that you don't have to do all of this. And instead, your CMS updates the sitemap files and we say, oh, look. There are 20 new pages and this is a great website. We will go and update that right away. So that's generally, from my point of view, the direction I'd prefer that we take. I think the tool for updating individual pages  

#### [0:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2040) |  is something that definitely makes sense for

other situations where maybe you can't do a sitemap file, or maybe you have something really urgent and you can't wait for someone to create a new sitemap file for you, or maybe there are other reasons, as well. I think that definitely makes sense, but I'd really prefer that normal updates of a website, that that's something that can be processed as automatically as possible, because it--  

#### [0:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2070) |  I don't know. It feels inefficient to

encourage you to fill out captchas just because you're making normal changes on a website. MARC OPITZ: Oh, true. OK, thank you. JOHN MUELLER: "What's the relationship between article length and ranking?" I don't think there is any relationship between article length and ranking. I think the aspect that most commonly comes into play  

#### [0:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2100) |  with article length and ranking is that,

for some topics, users expect longer articles. And when they reach your site, they're happier with finding some longer information. And for other, topics maybe they don't need a long article. And the one thing that I do kind of understand is, if you're kind of working together with a team of writers and you're ordering content from them based on specific topics  

#### [0:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2130) |  that you care about for your website,

and sometimes you specify a length and say, well, I at least want an article this long. But essentially, from an SEO point of view, there is no requirement to have a certain length of an article on your site, but rather it's more you need to be able to fulfill your user's needs. And sometimes you can do that quickly. Sometimes you can have a really long article with lots of details in it. There's a lot of room in between there.  

#### [0:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2160) |  Is it necessary to use the keyword

in exact match or not in the content? What's the best keyword strategy in the eyes of Google? It's not necessary to use exact match keywords within the content. And this is something that I think has been the case for a really long time now. In particular, we recognize things like synonyms. We recognize things like misspellings and kind  

#### [0:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2190) |  of singular and plural forms of keywords.

These are all things that our systems can recognize both in the query and within the content. And the newer machine learning based systems that we have, they go even further and try to understand, well, what is it that you're actually writing about here? And how does that match what the user is actually searching for? So with that in mind, you don't need to include all of the variations of all of the keywords that you care about within your content.  

#### [0:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2220) |  And I think most sites have been

doing fairly well with that. So it's no longer the case that you look at the top search results and it's just filled with kind of synonyms or misspellings, typos of the same keywords. So that's, I think, kind of a nice development there. What is the best keyword strategy in the eyes of Google? I think that's something where it's less a matter of SEO  

#### [0:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2250) |  from my point of view but more

a matter of marketing and finding topics that your audience cares about and being able to be out there as early as possible so that you can get your content in front of those people when they search for that information. So that's something where it's not the case that you need  

#### [0:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2280) |  to find the exact keywords or the

most important keywords that are out there, but really you need to figure out what it is that you have on your website, that's unique to your website, that users would be searching for where you can provide some unique value. And those are kind of the keywords to focus on. The one thing with keywords that I do want to mention, though, is that while it's not necessary to focus on exact match keywords within your content,  

#### [0:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2310) |  you should be a little bit specific

about what you want to rank for. So if you have a news article about something big happening, then don't kind of use kind of like descriptive phrases to describe that from happening. But rather, kind of mention the names. Mention the places. Be elaborate. And be specific on what is actually happening there. This is sometimes something that I see, especially  

#### [0:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2340) |  with smaller business websites, where you go

to the website and, as a user, even, if you look at the website, you're like, well, what is it that they do? Do they sell a product? Do they sell a service? Are they just the consulting company? Is this just a general marketing page? What is it that I, as a user, when I go to this website, I'm supposed to be doing? And if users can't really tell what exactly it is that you're doing, then probably search engines will have trouble, too.  

#### [0:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2370) |  And probably search engines will have trouble

figuring out what they should be ranking this page for. It might look really nice. But if it doesn't mention what it is that you want to provide and what it is that you want to appear and search for, then it's going to be hard to show. "Could you introduce a strategy on the improvement of the page indexing and the possibilities of time reduction between the bot's first visit and the entrance of the material and the search results?"  

#### [0:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2400) |  I don't quite know which direction that

goes. In general, when we crawl the website, or want to crawl a page from a website, it can take a bit of time for those pages to appear in the search results. But it's not something that we kind of purposely slow down. It's more that sometimes things take a little bit longer to be processed than others. Sometimes we can show that within a minute or so  

#### [0:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2430) |  of being crawled. So it's not that

there's a kind of an explicit delay there. "Who can we contact to receive the analysis of traffic and its fluctuations caused by the core update that occurred on September 24?" I'm not aware of any core update that occurred on September 24. So that's kind of one thing with regards  

#### [0:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2460) |  to receiving analysis data. The best way

to get data for your website is, on the one hand, to collect it yourself, using any of the kind of normal Analytics packages, and on the other hand, to use Google Search Console, where you can kind of track how your site is appearing in Search, and also get any information with regards to issues that might have popped up that our systems might be able to help flag for you.  

#### [0:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2490) |  MIHAI APERGHIS: John, regarding these core updates,

do you know if there's any plans to launch any new ones by the end of the year? Are there any? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know what the specific plans are there. So it's not the case that we stop making core updates. I just don't know what the specific launch plans are there. I think it's always tricky towards end of the year, because everyone's a little bit jittery, and probably  

#### [0:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2520) |  this year more than ever. So there

is a little bit of trickiness involved with, well, we'd like to make improvements in Search. And we think our users deserve to see those improvements in Search. But at the same time, we don't want it to be super disruptive. So I don't know what will happen there. It's possible at some point maybe  

#### [0:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2550) |  we'll still have an update. I don't

know what the timing would be there, because essentially all timing is bad when it comes to the last quarter of the year. MIHAI APERGHIS: Right. But just curious, these kind of updates are needed because there's no system to kind of do this automatically ongoing, so is it like sort of the old Panda and Penguin updates where you kind of needed to aggregate a lot of data then kind of crunch it  

#### [0:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2580) |  and then push the results into Google?

And then you kind of transitioned into doing that ongoing automatically? Is it kind of the same with the core updates? JOHN MUELLER: I don't think you can really compare those that well. So that's kind of one thing. The other thing is, a lot of times within the core updates we'll have bigger algorithmic changes.  

#### [0:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2610) |  So it's not so much that we're

changing, I don't know, the page rank of all of these pages kind of thing, but rather, we're kind of making bigger algorithmic changes in the way that our systems show things in the search results. So it's something where, if you change the algorithms between-- with regards to how we rank things in search, then sometimes you just have kind of that jarring jump  

#### [0:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2640) |  from one change to the other. MIHAI

APERGHIS: But are these changes related to what happened between these months from the past core update to this one? I mean, does it take any data based on crawling data, indexing data, and anything like that in order to kind of judge what the changes should be in the next core update? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know how to best answer that, because I think we do look at what  

#### [0:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2670) |  has been happening over time. And it's

something where we obviously look at the data that we've collected until then. And we try to use some of that with the next algorithmic changes. And for bigger algorithmic changes, we do all of the usual tests, the A/B tests with the quality raters, all of that. And essentially, that takes into account  

#### [0:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2700) |  the data that's been collected until then.

MIHAI APERGHIS: Yeah, OK. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I mean, it's-- I don't know. I generally prefer if we could do these algorithms a little bit smoother in that there isn't this jarring jump from one to the other. But sometimes that's just the way that it works out. MIHAI APERGHIS: This is why I was comparing to the Penguin  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VAg6CIUG3Kg/hq3.jpg)



#### [0:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2730) |  algorithms, because there was also that kind

of big change overnight. So this is why I was wondering if it's something like that, in the sense that you are planning to smooth out these changes so it's more an ongoing thing rather than all of a sudden. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I mean, if it were just a matter of changing the page rank values or something like that, then that's something where you can smooth that out and easily kind of spread that out over the course of a couple of weeks  

#### [0:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2760) |  or so, and so on. But it

doesn't look that jarring. I mean, sometimes also having a jarring change is useful for site owners, because then you can understand a little bit where things have changed. But I generally prefer when things are smoothed out. MIHAI APERGHIS: One last thing. So are these changes usually related to kind of you understanding the data better,  

#### [0:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2790) |  or are they more related to, maybe

we should waive this factor a bit more or this factor a bit less? Or is it kind of the same but, oh, now we better understand what this page is about, or something like that? JOHN MUELLER: I think all of that comes together. MIHAI APERGHIS: OK. Makes sense. JOHN MUELLER: I think there are always so many factors that are involved with these algorithmic changes. So it's always tricky.  

#### [0:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2820) |  Cool. We're kind of running towards the

end of time-- well, the end of this session, at least. Not end of time, hopefully. If there are any questions from you all that you'd like to ask, feel free to jump on in. JONNY JONES: Hi, John. MANUTTAPONG TREEPANIT: Hi John. OK. JONNY JONES: You go ahead. You go ahead. MANUTTAPONG TREEPANIT: Thank you. Hi, John. I'm [INAUDIBLE] with my team.  

#### [0:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2850) |  So now I'm translator for him. We

are Thai. So I could say I'm sorry for my Thai not that good. But I will try my best. For our problem is the Search Console on the indexing in the part of user [INAUDIBLE] it's not our website. You know, it's not our website.  

#### [0:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2880) |  And we try to figure it out.

We tried to figure it out on this problem. But we couldn't fix it. We couldn't fix it. And we have a host, Google host, in Thailand. And they couldn't help us, as well. So do you have any suggestion for us to do or how we can do?  

#### [0:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2910) |  And the second one that about the

site, our website, that we can find our website on Google. It's another website that I mentioned you. So what can we do? Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: OK. That sounds a little bit more complicated.  

#### [0:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2940) |  So my recommendation there would be perhaps

to post the details, as much as you can, in the Webmaster Help forum. We have a forum in English that I know is fairly active. Mihai, for example, is active there. I don't know if we have one in Thai, specifically. But if you can post in the English forum, that would almost certainly--  

#### [0:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=2970) |  oh, yeah. Search Central Help Forum. We

changed the name. If you post there with the details of your website, and maybe some screenshots of what you're seeing, that would really help, because it feels like maybe there is something specific with your website or with the way that it's hosted or the way that it's shown in search. And those are sometimes hard to kind of just give a general answer for. It would almost need to be that someone  

#### [0:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3000) |  looks at your specific case. MANUTTAPONG TREEPANIT:

All right. Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. JONNY JONES: Hey, John. If I can just quickly jump in. This is sort of related to the question that someone else asked in the YouTube-- on the YouTube page-- [INAUDIBLE]? It was around indexation and, are you guys serving pages after they run through your indexation process. Is there any-- do you know of any sort of delay that occurs  

#### [0:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3030) |  between a website or a page-- a

web page being indexed and then served due to-- and there's a delay because of, like, bad usability or mobile usability? Is there anything that exists like that? Or does that just not happen? JOHN MUELLER: I don't think we have any delay based on kind of like quality issues or things like that. So I mean, one of the things that happens  

#### [0:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3060) |  is we have to be able to

index the content. And if we have the content in the HTML forum, then we can pick that up right after the call. If we have to render that page first, then sometimes that causes a bit of a delay. But even that rendering delay, for the most part, is a matter of minutes. It's not a matter of hours or something that would be visible. And once we've indexed the content, then essentially it could appear in Search.  

#### [0:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3090) |  What might happen is that there is

a bit of a delay until we rank appropriately in Search. So if you're searching for something and it's very competitive, then understanding, oh, this is a good page for that query, that might be something that has a delay. It might also be, depending on the query, an issue-- well, not necessarily an issue, but kind of a matter of understanding how timely this page is.  

#### [0:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3120) |  So if you have a news article

on your site and we don't recognize that it's a news article offhand and it's a query where people are expecting kind of news about that topic, then it might be that we say, well, this is more of a general article on this topic. It's not a news article. So maybe we won't show it for this query. So kind of the indexing side is one thing where I think the timing should be fairly tight.  

#### [0:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3150) |  And the ranking side is kind of

a completely different question. JONNY JONES: Right. OK. I get you on the ranking side, where it might not show up because it's a really competitive term. But if you're searching for the exact headline or if you're doing, like, a site search and you're not seeing it there, would you say that's problematic? Or is that normal behavior?  

#### [0:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3180) |  JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. It seems

weird. But it can happen sometimes. So for the most part, if you're explicitly looking for that page and you know that it's indexed, then it feels like we should be able to show that, unless there is something really kind of blocking with that page in particular. JONNY JONES: Yeah, that's kind of why I was rounding back to the mobile usability and that potentially being  

#### [0:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3210) |  a hindrance there, or that there's an

issue with Google being able to process things. JOHN MUELLER: I don't think so. I mean, if it's a matter of usability of the page but we have the textual content, then that shouldn't be an issue that would prevent us from showing it at all. It might be kind of going into more of the ranking side of things, where it's like, well, we could show it, but we're not showing it in the top position, or something like that. But it shouldn't be something that would block us  

#### [0:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3240) |  from showing that page. JONNY JONES: OK.

Thanks, John. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. JOY F: Hi, John. Can I follow up on that? Sorry. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. JOY F: Yeah. So you just mentioned that if you recognize or if you don't think an article is newsworthy, you wouldn't serve it for specific terms. I'm curious kind of what you're looking at on that page to identify that, other than mentioning what people are kind of looking for at that time. Are there any other things you're looking for on the site  

#### [0:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3270) |  specifically? JOHN MUELLER: It's hard to say.

So I don't think we have any explicit guidelines on what you need to do to make something look like a news article. Usually, I imagine that's something that we just pick up overall for our site. So it's less a matter of specific kind of meta tags or specific headings or a specific site structure  

#### [0:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3300) |  that you need to have there. It's

more about understanding, well, there is an article associated with this page. And we regularly see new articles on this site with new dates, kind of that general setup there. It's not-- I don't think that's the case that we look for any one particular factor to say, well, this is a news article, or this is more of a reference article or an evergreen article.  

#### [0:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3330) |  JOY F: Thank you. JOAO ALMEIDA: Hi,

John. Can I pop in with just a quick question? JOHN MUELLER: Sure. JOAO ALMEIDA: OK, so just a brief context. I have a website that was stolen about one year ago. And two weeks after that, the guy that stole my website redirected to another domain. And two weeks after that, he redirect that domain back to my original domain. So meanwhile, I was able to recover my website with a court action in US. So I entered a court action in Victoria state. So I was able to recover my website.  

#### [0:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3360) |  And that other domain is no longer

working. So the B domain that the other guy created is no longer working, but Google is still indexing that other site with the contents of my site, with the fresh contents of my site. So if I go to Google, if I search for the other website, I will see the contents for my website from yesterday, from two days ago. So why is Google indexing the sites that, when you go to that site, is returning a Cloudflare 522 error, but Google is showing my contents, my fresh contents  

#### [0:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3390) |  of my real website. JOHN MUELLER: What

kind of query are you-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] JOAO ALMEIDA: --redirection, historical redirection, that that site [? add in ?] because it does not find the site URL it will go to that redirect. JOHN MUELLER: What kind of query are you doing to see the other site? JOAO ALMEIDA: So if I site semicolon and then the site, I see 13,000 pages with my contents. But for some specific queries, I see that other site also appearing before my site, or at the same level of my website.  

#### [0:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3420) |  JOHN MUELLER: OK. So usually, if you

do a site query for a site that is redirecting, we may show the previous site for that. And that's something where our systems, when they look at the ranking, they try to understand what it is that you're searching for. And if it looks like you're searching for one specific website, then we'll show you that website in the search results, even if we know that it has been redirecting for a longer time.  

#### [0:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3450) |  So you see this often with site

moves, if you move from one domain to another. Probably also in a case like yours. One way to confirm that this is the case is if you look at the cached page of one of those results. And usually, if you look at that page, then the URL we show on top is from the destination page. And that essentially means we're indexing your pages. But we know that these old URLs were also associated with it.  

#### [0:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3480) |  So if you explicitly look for those

old URLs, then we will show you those URLs. But if you look for the normal content, then we will show you your website. So that's kind of the one thing there. If you're still seeing it for generic queries, where someone is not explicitly looking for that old website, that seems more like a bug on our side, or an issue of us just not having processed it for those particular URLs yet.  

#### [0:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3510) |  So if you want, you're welcome to

send me some examples there. I am happy to take a look. But in general, also that's something that might just depend on the timing, where if you've kind of updated your site and it's fairly fresh and we just haven't re-crawled those old URLs and understood that actually, these are separate now, then that's something that can still take place in terms of a couple of months even after these changes are  

#### [0:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3540) |  made. And one way to kind of

help with that is to make sure that on your website, you're submitting a proper sitemap file so that we really understand, this is your website and we can re-crawl your website as quickly as possible with your fresh content and show that properly in Search. JOAO ALMEIDA: OK. So how can I send you some examples? Is it by Twitter message or-- JOHN MUELLER: Let me just drop my email here in the chat.  

#### [0:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3570) |  JOAO ALMEIDA: OK. JOHN MUELLER: And then--

yeah. But like I said, the site query results, I think those will continue to be there for a longer period of time. I've seen cases where we've kept that connection for several years, even though the site has moved to a different domain. But if you explicitly look for the old domain, our systems will try to be helpful and say, oh, we know what you're looking for.  

#### [1:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3600) |  And it's not really-- like, if you

use it for diagnostics purposes, that's not very useful. JOAO ALMEIDA: OK. Thank you, John. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. OK, we're essentially out of time for here. I have a little bit more time that I can stick around, so I will just pause the recording for the moment. If any of you all want to hang around a little bit longer and continue to talk about these topics, you're welcome to do that.  

#### [1:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg6CIUG3Kg&t=3630) |  Otherwise, I wish you all a great

weekend. And hopefully see you all again in one of future Hangouts. Thanks, everyone. MANUTTAPONG TREEPANIT: Thank you. MARC OPITZ: Thank you very much. Bye bye. MANUTTAPONG TREEPANIT: Bye.
