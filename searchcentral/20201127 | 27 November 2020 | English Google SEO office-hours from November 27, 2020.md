#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=0) |  JOHN MUELLER: All right, welcome, everyone, to

today's Google Search Central office hours hangout. My name is John Mueller. I'm a Search Advocate on the Search Relations team. And part of what we do are these office hour hangouts where people can join in and ask their question around their website, around web search. And we can try to find some answers for you. A bunch of things were submitted already, a lot more than I expected. I thought this would be kind of a fairly low key one,  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=30) |  but it's always good when things get

submitted. But if any of you want to get started with the first question, you're welcome to jump on in. AUDIENCE: Yeah, so, Hi, John. We have a question that's kind of keeping us on the edge for quite some time, because we would really love to know when the URL inspection tool will start to work again.  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=60) |  Do you have any suggestion or any

possible timeframe, because it's not available for six weeks. And we have some-- we had some great results and really fast indexing in the past with the URL inspection tool. And so a lot of our content and the crawling of our content is obviously stored this way. And we would just be very interested  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=90) |  in a possible relaunch. JOHN MUELLER: I

don't have any news on the timing there. But in general, websites should be able to get crawled and indexed normally within reasonable time without using manual tools like that. So my general advice there would be, if you rely on this for normal content that you add to your website, is to think about ways to really improve the quality of your website  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=120) |  overall so that our systems are kind

of keen to go to your website all the time to get the freshest information. So to me, that would be kind of a signal that something on your side isn't the way that our systems would ideally like it to be, and less that you should use this tool as a way to do normal site maintenance and normal updates.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=150) |  I definitely see its uses in cases

where something urgently needs to change. And you made a mistake on your website and you need to get that updated as quickly as possible. That's something where I think this tool is fantastic for. But for everything where you're updating things, you're adding new posts to your site, if you need this tool, then it feels like you're kind of covering up the actual problems on a website,  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=180) |  because from our point of view, search

should just work automatically. It's not something that should require any kind of manual intervention. AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks very much. So we'll look into that. So it's not that the crawling is then too long or has any crucial problems. It's just that it's obviously, in our experience, way slower than when you manually trigger the index.  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=210) |  And so that's just because we're curious

to see when the inspections will be [INAUDIBLE] again. JOHN MUELLER: No, I don't have any updates on that. I know the team is working on it. So it's not that it's going away or anything crazy like that, though it is something where, internally, people talk about it, and say, like, well, people shouldn't really be using it for any kind of normal site changes. They should try to find ways to make that update automatically with site maps and all of that.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=240) |  But no, hopefully it'll be back soon.

Cool, any other questions before we get started? AUDIENCE: If I may? JOHN MUELLER: Sure. AUDIENCE: OK, first of all, thank you for having this call and for giving the information and answering the questions.  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=270) |  I hope you will do that. My

name is Alexei Ivanov. And I'm from Russia. I represent Rambler and Co Media Holding. And we have a question we have asked at the page where you have been gathering the questions, but the thing is, when you sort the questions by popularity, it just disappears. And when you sort them by time, it is the first one. So I wasn't sure if you will be able to see it and answer it.  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=300) |  So if I may ask it, it

will be great. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. AUDIENCE: So the question is quite specific. And it relates to some localization. And the question is about live blog posting markup and the badge, live badge. So what we saw, that, for example,  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=330) |  if you take bbc.com and search for

some articles from bbc.com form the US, you might find that it has a badge live on the result. And the same badge, you can see if you search from Russia for the articles. So we did this markup too. And we found out that, for our website--  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=360) |  it's Russian-- this works if you search

from the US. And we have the badge live. But it doesn't work if you search from Russia. And our goal, as you might understand, was to get this badge in Russian results. So any comments on that? Maybe you can tell us that this works with ANP, for example, because we search through the documentation.  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=390) |  And some details can be found like

tip, use the live blog posting metadata markup so your blog can be integrated with the third-party platform features. So any comment? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I don't know the specifics there. I thought the live blog posting was also something that we're just trying out with individual sites at the moment. So that might be something that is playing in there.  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=420) |  But if you could drop maybe some

examples into the chat here, then I can pick that up afterwards and pass it on to the team to check out. Or if you have the examples in the question itself, then I can pull it from there. AUDIENCE: No, we don't have examples in the question itself. But I think me or my colleague will drop some screenshots into the chat here. JOHN MUELLER: Fantastic, cool. OK, happy to take a look. AUDIENCE: Thank you. AUDIENCE: Hi, John.  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=450) |  JOHN MUELLER: Hi. AUDIENCE: So I had

a follow up on your URL submission in search console. So this tool is going to be live with more features or with the same features that we had already? Because the way it is is taking so much time. It could be-- we feel like it will be also revamped. JOHN MUELLER: I don't have any updates on that. So you'll have to stay tuned. AUDIENCE: OK, cool.  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=480) |  AUDIENCE: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. AUDIENCE:

Hi, this is Derek from Singapore. So I do have a question regarding conflicting hreflang signals. So let's say we have implemented the correct hreflang using site maps, but because of some reasons, the web pages also have another set of hreflangs in there, even though they are not the most correct version.  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=510) |  I know that we have to try

to minimize conflicting hreflangs like this. So my question for you is, how does Google actually treat these conflicting hreflangs? Do they prioritize the site maps [INAUDIBLE] on-page hreflang or vice versa? Yeah, so any comments for that? JOHN MUELLER: What kind of conflicting hreflangs do you have? AUDIENCE: So for example, I may have a hreflang directive that is correct in the site map that says that this page is meant  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=540) |  for English US users, but then the

same page, the source code for the same page may be showing French US. JOHN MUELLER: OK, so what would happen there is we would combine those. So from our point of view, hreflang is not something where we say you can only have one language or country version on one page, but rather, you  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=570) |  can have multiple country versions on the

same page. And you can have multiple different levels. So you could say, this is the page for English in Singapore, English in, I don't know, US, English in the UK. And you have a different page for English in Australia, for example. But you can have one page with multiple kind of country regional targeting on them. So if you have some hreflang in the HTML and some in the site map, then we would try to combine that and add that together.  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=600) |  And that means that if you have

kind of multiple different country versions across those different things, we would just combine that into one setup. The one place where it would get confusing or where we would see it as conflicting is if you have one country language version on the page and you use the same country language version for a different page in the site map file.  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=630) |  That would be the kind of situation

where our systems would probably have to guess. And as far as I know, we don't have any prioritization where we say site maps is better than HTML or better than the headers, but rather, we will just see, well, this doesn't work. And we would probably just drop that pair. AUDIENCE: OK, thank you so much. JOHN MUELLER: Sure.  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=660) |  AUDIENCE: John? Hi, how are you? So

if a publisher owns several different sites and sometimes promotes or recommends the same content across its network but they're not trying to dupe Google that it's original, it's just part of-- they want to signal that it's part of the same network, what can they do to signal that it's not original content, but just being promoted or recommended? Should they use rel equals canonical?  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=690) |  Or is there some other mechanism? JOHN

MUELLER: No, usually the rel canonical is the best method to let us know that, like, this is your preferred version. And from a practical point of view, it's not so much that the web spam team would get upset about that situation. It's just that the publisher is kind of spreading themselves thin. And instead of saying, this is one really strong version of my content, it's like, I put it on 20 different sites.  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=720) |  And like, they can all rank maybe.

So it's kind of diluting the value. But with the rel canonical, you can help to concentrate the value on the version that you prefer to have indexed. AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think it's more of not trying to even-- it's more of a, like, here is our network. And if you're interested in this, you might also be interested in this. It's not really to rank, in fact. It's just to recommend. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, that's-- I mean, that's a totally common use case for that.  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=750) |  AUDIENCE: OK, all right, thank you. JOHN

MUELLER: Sure. AUDIENCE: John, quick follow up on that-- so in cases where there's a network with-- it's the same business but it has, like, 10 websites, let's say, and each website kind of links to another one using keyword-rich anchor text, does Google determine that, oh, it's from the same business, so it's kind of like an internal link?  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=780) |  Or can it be a problem? And

can it affect the manual action or anything like that? JOHN MUELLER: For the most part, we can figure that out. And we treat that as normal links. So it's not problematic. I think it would get problematic if you had a really large network of sites. And if it starts looking more like, oh, you're just using these links for SEO means rather than to kind of, like, say, well  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=810) |  these are other places where you can

also get similar products or you can find our business online. AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm asking since there is a thread in the private forums regarding that. And somebody has a manual action. And within the manual action, a few examples of those links are from a website, part of the business' set of websites, network.  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i_5ap7c0ynA/hq1.jpg)



#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=840) |  JOHN MUELLER: I mean, usually with manual

actions, there is a much bigger pattern involved than just like, oh, there is one bad example in kind of the set there. It's really kind of a bigger-picture problem. So it can happen that some of the examples are kind of like, if you look at them, you can be picking, and say, well, this link is actually OK. But if you look at the bigger picture, it's like, well, there is actually a bigger pattern here.  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=870) |  And this is just one kind of

thing that fits into the bigger pattern, but is also kind of something debatable. You could talk about it. AUDIENCE: OK, so should that webmaster do anything about that link? If he or she sees it in the manual action example links, what should they do about it? JOHN MUELLER: So it's my recommendation there would be to fix the bigger issue, the broader overall issue first.  

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=900) |  And if that's something specific with that

link, or you're saying, well, actually, I'm going to keep this link, because I think it's right, then that's something I would include in the text of the manual-- of the reconsideration request, and kind of say, there were five links. And it's like, I cleaned the bigger issue that the five links point out. And there was one extra link there that I think is OK. And I kept that. AUDIENCE: OK, and one more thing regarding this--  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=930) |  so as far as I understand it,

this is a network with very large websites. Like, they have millions of pages. And the business sometimes buys other websites. So in this case, the links in those two examples that the team sent were from a property that the business just bought. And it was a very large million-pages website. And so can this pose as a problem in the sense  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=960) |  that, if they just bought the website,

Google has no way of knowing that it belongs to that business now or anything like that? JOHN MUELLER: Maybe? I don't know. I'd have to take a look at the thread. It sounds like there is a bigger story behind it. AUDIENCE: OK, cool. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. OK, let me run through some of the questions that were submitted. And we can chat more afterwards as well. I don't actually sort them in any particular order  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=990) |  when they come from the YouTube [INAUDIBLE]..

So it's, like, just taking them as they show up here. I think this is generally sorted by whatever YouTube's ranking system does. I don't know how you can game that. Do you treat anchor text that contains many words differently in comparison to anchor text that contains two words only? I mean, do you assign more value to those two words when you compare it to anchor text that has, like, seven or eight words?  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1020) |  For example, two-words anchor text like "cheap

shoes," and the seven-words anchor is "you can buy cheap shoes here." Can you elaborate on that? So I don't think we do anything special for the length of the words in the anchor text, but rather, we use this anchor text as a way to provide extra context for the individual pages. And sometimes if you have a longer anchor text,  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1050) |  that gives us a little bit more

information. Sometimes it's kind of like just a collection of different keywords. So from that point of view, I wouldn't see any of these as being better or worse. And it's something where, like, especially for internal linking, you want to probably focus more on things like how can you make it clearer for your users that, when you click on this link, this is what they'll find? So that's kind of the way that I would like data here.  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1080) |  I wouldn't say that shorter anchor text

is better or shorter anchor text is worse. It's just different context. Let's say you look at a page and test it to see what's there. And you decide that it wasn't relevant after collecting signals. Let's say I improve that page to make it the best out there for those queries. Would you automatically test it and try to look if it's the best page out there even though you've collected all those signals  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1110) |  and it wasn't the best piece of

content for those queries in the past? Absolutely. So pages can change over time. Pages can get significantly better over time. Pages can get worse over time. That's absolutely possible. So that's something where, if we've collected signals and found the page to be like this in the past, it doesn't mean it will always be like that.  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1140) |  So from that point of view, if

you have pages on your site and you significantly improve them, our system should be able to look at that over time and say, well, this is a much better page now than it was before. So that's something that definitely gets updated. And I think the hreflang question, we talked about briefly. I noticed that free websites created on business.site have a follow link in the footer that goes to the page that redirects  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1170) |  to google.com/busin ess/websitebuilder. Isn't this against Google's

guidelines on link schemes? I don't know. I didn't take a look at the exact example here. I think we looked at this one in one of the previous hangouts a while ago as this kind of started rolling out. In general, when it comes to these kind of links, what we try to look at is the specific anchor text  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1200) |  there. So if it's something where, when

we look at it, it looks like, oh, it's promoting this website in a way that it uses very keyword-rich anchor text, then that would be more problematic. If it's essentially just linking to the URL or if it's using the business name as something that is linking to the website name, then usually that's less of an issue. So from my point of view, if this were any random website,  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1230) |  I wouldn't really say much there. But

since it is a Google property, I will pass it onto the Web Spam Team just to double check to see that they're OK with this. I don't know what will happen there with the Web Spam Team. It's very possible that we already ignore these specific links, because these are the kind of links that are very easy for our systems to pick up and say, well, we can just ignore those.  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1260) |  But it is always awkward to get

these reports that Google properties aren't doing things perfectly. What's the difference between-- AUDIENCE: The thing is, but I think the problem is that everyone that asks those type of questions hopes that the answer is going to be, you've got us. OK, you're all right as well, rather than, OK, we'll fix our site. You're never going to go the direction of letting everyone else get away with it  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1290) |  rather than just fixing your own problem.

So I don't know why people ask these questions. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I mean-- AUDIENCE: OK, we'll forgive all of your penalties. You're right. You caught us. Everyone's fine to do it as well. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah-- AUDIENCE: It's just a [INAUDIBLE] question that gets nowhere. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I mean, I totally understand that it's frustrating, like, especially if a website got a manual action for buying links, or doing this kind of thing  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1320) |  in footer links across other sites. It

is frustrating to see other sites kind of get away with that, but yeah. AUDIENCE: If you build a $100-billion network then I think you have a little bit of leeway to do what you want. That's my opinion. [INTERPOSING VOICES] JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I think it's worth also to hold our sites to a little bit of a higher standard just to make sure that we're really  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1350) |  kind of doing the right thing. AUDIENCE:

Yeah, but you'll be linking from one very high-quality website to another very high-quality website with a purpose. Is that not fine? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I don't know. We'll see what the Web Spam Team says. AUDIENCE: I look forward to your penalty. JOHN MUELLER: It wouldn't be the first time. I mean, one of the tricky parts with all of these things  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1380) |  is that, just because someone works at

Google, they don't know all of the kind of ways to do SEO perfectly. So it is very common to see sites across Google do SEO in a way where, like, if it were to come to the forum, people would be like, oh, god. AUDIENCE: I don't-- it's not my style, too. But I'm not sure Google should be punishing naivety. It should be punishing people that deliberately  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1410) |  do things to game the system. If

you don't know anything about SEO, then, by definition, nothing you've done could be penalty worthy, because you're not trying to game the system. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I think the way I see it more is to kind of level the playing field, in the sense that it's not always the intent, but rather the effect. And if our systems can't kind of neutralize that effect  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1440) |  on their own, then maybe we need

to manually just neutralize it so there is no negative effect on the search results. AUDIENCE: John, I had one follow up on this link penalty or link manual action. So I was just going through a link scheme document. There are two types of links, basically, that Google has documented. One is a first paragraph, which is talking about link scheme.  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1470) |  And the next paragraph talks about unnatural

links. So in links, I want just to know, in links scheme, I was noticing it was like, buying or selling links is against Google guidelines. That was one thing, right? Or excessive link exchange, you will give me a link, I will give you a link-- and the other thing was unnatural language was all talking about unnatural links. Like, keyword-rich was mentioned over there. So I just, I was a little confused about, really,  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1500) |  Google considers both these sections for manual

action or unnatural link is related to manual action? Because for the first section, link scheme, I never saw any manual action or any penalty like some websites are having excessive give me link or I will give you a link, this kind of strategy. I have also personally saw a lot of websites buying links also in web. They are just buying the links.  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1530) |  But how Google treats them? Does Google

also consider links scheme as manual selection for the websites? JOHN MUELLER: Sure, yeah, absolutely. I mean, it is always tricky to see this from the outside, because just because a website has a manual action doesn't mean it will not show up in search. So unless there is something that is really problematic with the content itself, then we would keep that website in the search results.  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1560) |  We would just try to neutralize the

effect that is happening there. And sometimes we can't isolate that effect completely. And we kind of neutralize a little bit more than just that effect. But essentially, just because a website is in the search results and they're doing something shady doesn't mean that they're getting away with doing something shady or that they're ranking because they're doing something shady. So on the one hand, our systems try to automatically  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1590) |  just ignore those things. And even if

there is a manual action, then it wouldn't remove the website completely from search. AUDIENCE: So it means that Google also just neutralizes those linked scheme links? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I mean, we try. I'm sure there are situations where we don't manage to do that automatically. And that's what the manual actions are for. And we can't catch everything on the web,  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1620) |  but it is one of those things

that we work on. AUDIENCE: All right, thanks. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. All right, now a question from the new crawl stats report. What's the difference between discovery and refresh? In our case, it's showing 84% refresh. Does that mean 84% of the time Google is crawling known URLs from their database and only 16% of the time they crawl our site, site maps, out links from URLs  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1650) |  that they crawl from the known URL

database? So I'm not 100% sure of what exactly we would put into each of those buckets. But in general, we do split things up into kind of refresh crawling where we try to update the information that we have on a site, and discovery crawling where we try to find new URLs that we've heard about from the website, which could be things  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i_5ap7c0ynA/hq2.jpg)



#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1680) |  like from new internal links or from

external links pointing at your website. So that's something where, for a large part, I would imagine for most sites, a lot of the crawling is concentrated on just refreshing the information that we have. And that refresh crawl doesn't mean that we're just updating the page's content. We're also looking for new links which we can then use for kind of discovering new content. And yeah, that's generally how we kind of deal with that.  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1710) |  Does a link that qualifies as referral

traffic, so it gets [? klink, ?] get more link in equity than a link that has never been clicked on? I don't think so. On the one hand, I don't think we would be able to see what people actually click on. On the other hand, I don't think that would usually make sense. Sometimes links are out there. And they're really important references,  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1740) |  but they rarely get used by users.

But that can still be a useful reference. I have a question about indexing queries that are non-English. Does Googlebot actually go through translation algorithm in order to understand the meta title, meta descriptions before indexing them? If yes, is the same algorithm that is being used in Google Translate? And how can we be assured when it comes to accuracy?  

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1770) |  So for the most part, we index

the content on pages the way that we find it. It's not that we try to kind of normalize everything into English, and then only index it in English, and then if people search we try to understand the query, and translate it, and show it back again. It's essentially, we index the content the way that it comes. So if you have a website in a language where maybe Google  

#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1800) |  Translate is not so good yet, then

we will still index that content in that language. And when someone searches in that language, we will try to map those words and point to them directly as well. So from that point of view, we don't need to translate things into different languages. That said, we did some experiments in the past. And I don't know if that's still live in some regions.  

#### [0:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1830) |  Especially in places where we don't have

a lot of content, what we have done is when someone searches in their local language and we recognize that there isn't a lot of content in that specific language, then we may try to translate the query into a different language, and bring results from that different language, and show those as well, and say like, you search for this in your language.  

#### [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1860) |  And here are some results that were

in English. And we can show you the Google Translate version of those pages. So it's not so much that we translate the pages before indexing them, but rather, we take the query and then say, oh, there isn't a lot of information for this. But for the translated version there is. And then we try to search for the translated version of the query itself. And that's something you would see in the search results directly. If you search, then you kind of see that this is happening.  

#### [0:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1890) |  I don't know if we still do

this or if that's just in individual locations. But that is something, depending on your location, that you might have run into. What about Google News appearing issue for new publishers after the December 2019 update? I don't have any update from the Google News side. I'm also not on the Google News team, so I can't really help you with those specific issues.  

#### [0:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1920) |  My recommendation there would be to kind

of go to the Help forum. In general, when it comes to Google News, it's something where what we show in Google News is kind of different ranking algorithms than we would use for Google search. On many PDPs, we have very old user reviews, professional reviews. Can old date on those reviews create negative impact for that page?  

#### [0:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1950) |  So PDPs I think are product detail

pages. So especially on e-commerce site, if you have for one particular product, for example, a landing page, it's totally fine to have odd reviews on a page like that. I don't think there would be any downsides to having kind of those older reviews there. I think that can be very useful for users.  

#### [0:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=1980) |  Is search volume of a brand and

ranking factor? How does Google know brand of a website and show a site links, click through rate, or backlinks? I don't think search volume of a brand would be that useful as a ranking factor, because if someone is searching for that brand, we would already try to show that brand anyway, because probably, the brand's landing pages very, very relevant for those kind of queries.  

#### [0:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2010) |  So I don't think the volume of

brand queries themselves would make a big difference there. With regards to knowing the brand of a website and showing site links, that is sometimes hard, sometimes quite straightforward when we can recognize that a website is very relevant to a specific query. And sometimes we can recognize that by, like, the site-wide information on the website,  

#### [0:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2040) |  and recognize, oh, well this whole website

is on this specific topic. Maybe that is the name of the website. Or maybe that is the brand of the website. So it's less a matter of people linking to this website saying, oh, this is a brand, or a matter of people clicking on the links, but more like, well, this website is just very relevant for that specific phrase or word.  

#### [0:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2070) |  Event-rich snippets-- I have a list of

sports events on my site that are imported through an iFrame. Can crawlers read the data on the iFrame? That's tricky, because sometimes we can and sometimes we can't. So my recommendation there would be to think about what you would like to have happen here and to make it as obvious as possible for us  

#### [0:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2100) |  that we should be doing that. So

if you're embedding these sports events on your website and you want to have them associated with your website, then my recommendation would be to try to implement them directly on the page itself. If you can't do that within the static HTML, maybe there is a way to pull them in using JavaScript in a way that we can render the page and also see those events on the page. On the other hand, if you don't want those events associated  

#### [0:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2130) |  with your website, then maybe using something

like an iFrame is fine. But probably, you would also want to use robots txt on the iFramed content itself so that you can really be sure that we don't take them into account. So that would be my recommendation there. I think using an iFrame and saying, like, I don't care if they get indexed. Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. That's kind of fine. But usually when you're running a website like this and you're trying to optimize it,  

#### [0:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2160) |  you have something specific in mind that

you would like to have happen. And if that means you want those things to be indexed on your pages, then make it so that it's easy for us to recognize that. If you don't want them indexed, then make it so that we can recognize that they shouldn't be indexed. Can I use an anchor in an event snippet link?  

#### [0:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2190) |  I mean, you can definitely use it.

But whether or not we would show it, I think probably we would not show it. As far as I know, the only place where we would show links in the rich results would be the FAQ markup in the answers to the individual questions. I think otherwise, we don't show links that are included in rich results. Do I have to satisfy all the criteria for event snippets  

#### [0:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2220) |  to show? Other websites don't satisfy them.

And their events snippets are visible. I don't know. I mean, it kind of goes back to the first part there where it's like, well, what do you want to have happen? And if you really want these snippets to be shown for your website, then I would make it as clear as possible that everything is OK, that we can recognize them, that you're following the guidelines, and that you're kind of doing everything  

#### [0:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2250) |  you can to make them appear. So

that would be my recommendation there. And it's kind of regardless of what other websites are doing. It's really a matter of like is your website really doing everything it can to make sure that our systems can recognize that it's relevant and OK to show those snippets? I'm very interested in the development of Web Stories. As of now, they only appear in Google Search and Discover  

#### [0:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2280) |  in the United States, India, and Brazil.

Is there a time frame when they will come to Europe? I don't know. Good question. Yeah, I-- whenever I think about Web Stories, I assume that they're already everywhere. But apparently, they're just shown in individual places. The thing with Web Stories is also, they're normal HTML pages. So they can rank in the normal search results like any other kind of page.  

#### [0:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2310) |  However, I think the embedding, especially in

Search and Discover, where it's a little bit the more fancy type of embedding, that is something that is limited to individual locations at the moment. With all of these things, I can't give any prediction of when they will be expanded and come to other locations. Sometimes it's a matter of refining the technical details and the UI. Sometimes it's a matter of policy questions as well.  

#### [0:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2340) |  So that's always a bit tricky and

not something I can guess for other teams at Google. AUDIENCE: John, just curious regarding Web Stories, what do you do with your have a certain type of content that you wish to present in kind of a long-form format-- maybe it's thousands of words-- but you also want to benefit from exposure of via the Discover and Search Web Stories carousels?  

#### [0:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2370) |  Should you do both? Should you do

just one? Or would the Web Stories be in kind of a smaller format in terms of text content? Can that be a problem? Should you canonicalize the two? JOHN MUELLER: I think it's totally up to you. So what I have seen a lot is that a Web Story is a really nice way to build interest on a topic  

#### [0:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2400) |  and then to link to the more

detailed page, because a Web Story is usually something you would look at on your mobile phone. You're kind of, like, in a mood to be a little bit entertained and informed. So presenting it in a way that is visually compelling and interesting, and then having kind of that read more link at the end, I think that's a pretty nice model. But how that works for your specific content is really hard to say.  

#### [0:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2430) |  And it is also something where I've

seen some sites do it really well, and that they have really nice and visually-compelling content, a little bit animated. And other sites essentially just use clip art or just use images from a blog post, where, when you look at them in Web Story format, it's like, well, it's not really that exciting. And probably what--  

#### [0:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2460) |  I mean, I don't know the details.

My guess what will happen there is we might show this Web Story. But if users kind of get lost on the first couple of pages, and they're like, eh, this is not really that interesting. Then they're not going to click through to your site. So yeah. AUDIENCE: So in cases where a lot of the traffic is coming from desktop pages, can you, like, have a fallback? So instead of showing the Web Stories, the same your URL  

#### [0:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2490) |  shows a normal blog post, anything like

that? JOHN MUELLER: I don't think that would work that well with Search, because we would index one set of content for that URL. If you have, like, a long-form blog post and you show Google the Web Story so that you get the Web Story ranking, then you miss a lot of information that is not in the Web Story.  

#### [0:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2520) |  So that's something where I would tend

to just see them as separate formats where maybe you're kind of referring to one or the other in the different locations. AUDIENCE: OK, but if it's not that much content though, is it OK to have a blog post, a normal blog post, and a Web Stories, and the blog post canonicalizes to the Web Stories so that Google shows--  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i_5ap7c0ynA/hq3.jpg)



#### [0:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2550) |  would Google show the normal blog post

on desktop users and the Web Story for mobile users? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. Yeah, my guess is our systems aren't kind of designed for that. And the outcome is a little bit unknown. So I mean, if it ends up that people will do this very frequently, which, from my point of view  

#### [0:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2580) |  probably doesn't make sense, because the amount

of content is just very different-- but if people ended up doing it more frequently, then I think we'd have to come up with a way to deliberately do this so that you can, kind of with a desktop and mobile page, you can say this is my alternate for the desktop page and this is the canonical for the mobile page kind of thing. But at least at the moment, I don't think we have any provision to understand that one URL is both  

#### [0:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2610) |  a Web Story and a traditional-- AUDIENCE:

A normal page. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. AUDIENCE: Right. I was thinking, since I think, if I remember correctly, with Web Stories, you can kind of swipe up and put more content there. So you kind of have a bit of content on the image that you're being shown. And then you can swipe up and see additional text that, by default is hidden, but users can swipe up and see the text. So you can put a bit more text there apparently. I haven't tried this.  

#### [0:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2640) |  I've just seen examples. So I'm guessing

you could kind of, maybe smaller blog posts, kind of retrofit them into a Web Story format. JOHN MUELLER: My recommendation would be to try all of these things out. Like, especially with Web Stories, with kind of newer technologies, it's something where, like, theoretically you can talk about this in a long time. But it's sometimes more interesting to just try out  

#### [0:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2670) |  and see what actually happens. And then

you also kind of gain experience there. I know also the team that is working on Web Stories, they also run the Web Creators channel on Twitter. And they're currently looking for questions about Web Stories. So you might want to kind of find their Twitter account and drop some of the questions in that thread there too. AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks. JOHN MUELLER: OK, let me just grab maybe one or two more questions.  

#### [0:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2700) |  And then we can move to more

discussions. Some websites in the EU use a JavaScript-based GDPR cookie solution. And this prevents users from interacting with the site, navigating pages, reading content, or clicking links until they have either accepted or rejected cookies. Where this is implemented, will Google's crawling technology be able to crawl and index the content and internal links on the pages? I checked Google with cached versions of the pages of various pages on various sites  

#### [0:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2730) |  that use this solution. And the content

does not appear navigable. The links are also not clickable. So I don't know this specific cookie solution, so it's hard to say. In most of the cases that I have looked at, we can crawl and index the content normally. So what is important for us with any kind of interstitial,  

#### [0:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2760) |  or anything that you use as a

pop up or as a banner on a page, is that in the HTML version of the page, when we crawl it, we can find the information that you want to have indexed for that page. And that includes textual information. That includes all of the layout information, the CSS, the images, all of that, also the links on the page. And if those are in the HTML, even if they're blocked with some kind of an overlay  

#### [0:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2790) |  or some kind of a banner on

top, then essentially, from an indexing point of view, we can crawl and index that site. And my, at least what I've seen with the different kinds of cookie banners that sites tend to use, that all tends to work out. And this is something that is fairly easy to test on your site. You can use the Inspect UL tool to do a live test of your pages. And then you can look at the HTML version  

#### [0:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2820) |  that Google actually uses for rendering and

indexing. And within the HTML, you can check to see, is my content actually there? Are many links there? Is it formatted in a way that Google could understand? And if that's the case, then you're all set. And because these tools exist and have existed for a while now, pretty much all of the, I would say, mainstream types of implementations for this, they should be able to get this right.  

#### [0:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2850) |  When it comes to the cache page

that we provide, one of the things to keep in mind is this is based on the HTML page that we have fetched from the server. And sometimes JavaScript can run within the context of the cached URL. And sometimes it can't. And it depends a little bit on the JavaScript itself. The main issue here is that the cache page is, of course,  

#### [0:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2880) |  hosted on some Google domain. It's no

longer hosted on your domain. So if you have JavaScript that requires that it runs on your domain and is not able to run on other domains, which is often the case with kind of the security implications of JavaScript, then that JavaScript won't run. So a really common place where this comes into play is if you have a JavaScript-based website, and you look at the cache page and it's empty,  

#### [0:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2910) |  then you might assume that Google is

not able to index the content. But that's actually more kind of a technical thing that, within the context of this cached URL, JavaScript can't run. So you can't see that actual content there. And what might be happening in this case is maybe JavaScript can run for this particular kind of banner that you're using. And it's also blocking the cached version of the page. So that's something where, essentially,  

#### [0:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2940) |  that cookie banner thing that is running

on the cached version of the page would also apply there. But like I mentioned, the cached version is essentially more a technical copy of the HTML rather than a representation of what we would actually index. And to check the indexing, you'd need to use the Inspect URL tool. OK, we have just a few minutes left. So maybe I'll switch to questions from you.  

#### [0:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=2970) |  And I also have some more time

afterwards if any of you want to hang around a little bit longer. AUDIENCE: I have a question, actually, if you hear me, John. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. AUDIENCE: It is about actually programming languages and their documentations. Since we have so much versions in programming languages, they create duplicate content or nearly duplicate content. So we are using canonical text for making only one of them index.  

#### [0:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=3000) |  Or Google chooses one of them as

canonical version and tries to index just one of them. But this is also creating a kind of confusion between programmers, because actually, we are using old versions too. But when we search for them, we can find them on the Google Search. So we need to find them in the Stack Overflow while with internal source system, the websites. And some of the developer sites or programming language sites  

#### [0:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=3030) |  are using canonical tech in a manipulative

way. They are marking the new version as canonical from the older version. But actually, content is different. Yeah, purpose is the same, but the content is different. So what can we do to improve this situation? JOHN MUELLER: I think that's always tricky, because usually the names are exactly the same.  

#### [0:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=3060) |  And maybe the way that you call

the functions are slightly different. And it's hard to-- AUDIENCE: Also, the queries don't have versions. So even if I search for, I don't know, ECMAScript Six or ECMAScript Five, I am using just ECMAScript in the query. So I understand your point too. But I need a solution too. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, so my usual recommendation for this kind of issue is to try to keep  

#### [0:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=3090) |  the current version of the URL stable

and to move the older versions to kind of archive setup. So this is something that we run across with events or with different product generations. But it happens fairly frequently. Like, if you're searching for an iPhone, you probably want the newest iPhone, but you also want to find information about the older iPhones. So what we recommend doing there is then  

#### [0:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=3120) |  having a kind of a stable URL

for the current version, which could be-- like, I don't know which iPhone version is the current one, whatever number it is nowadays. And when a new device comes out, to take the old current version and move that into a separate URL-- so maybe you would have the new one is, I don't know, iPhone 15 or whatever it is. And then the iPhone 14 moves to a different URL which would be, like, iPhone-14, or something like that.  

#### [0:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=3150) |  And what would happen there is we

would not lose those older versions of content, but rather, we would notice that the stable URL is kind of the one that is the main version of the content. So if someone is specifically searching for just the newest iPhone, they would find that stable URL. But if they are looking explicitly for the older version, then they would still find the older version of that.  

#### [0:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=3180) |  And with programming languages you can probably

do something similar, where you say, well, this is the newest version of the JavaScript syntax and this is the current version. And when something new comes out, then we take the current version, move it to an archive, and say this is my ECMAScript Five, and kind of focus on-- kind of move that to an archive situation. AUDIENCE: OK, thank you for the recommendation. I will try that. JOHN MUELLER: OK. AUDIENCE: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. AUDIENCE: I have two questions about manual actions.  

#### [0:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=3210) |  The first is, after a manual action

is revoked, is there a kind of time frame in which the website has less trust than it would have without the previous manual action? And the second question is, if you start using the disavow tool, what happens if you completely remove the disavow file after many years? Is there risk of getting another manual action? Thanks. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, so when a manual action is revoked,  

#### [0:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=3240) |  essentially, everything that is associated with that

manual action is turned off. So if there were issues with links to your site or with the content on your site and the manual action is resolved, then that is completely resolved. Sometimes there are technical things on our side that just take a little bit of time to get updated. So for example, if a site is removed completely from indexing because it's just a scraped copy of other content  

#### [0:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=3270) |  and we were revoke that manual action,

then it takes a bit of time to get indexed again. And that's not because we don't trust the website anymore. It's just, for technical reasons, it takes some time. With regards to the disavow file, if you remove the disavow file, then all of those links will be treated as normal links again. And it could happen that at some point the Web Spam Team looks at that and says, oh, well this is very problematic.  

#### [0:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=3300) |  And there is no disavow file here

at the moment, so we will have to take a manual action there. And that's something that, from a spammer point of view, we have sometimes seen, where people will say, oh, I get a manual action. I fix my manual action. I know what to do, because I'm a professional at this. And the manual action is revoked. And they'll be like, OK, I will switch on all of the spam that I've been doing again.  

#### [0:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_5ap7c0ynA&t=3330) |  And that's something that the Web Spam

Team has also run across. And when they see this kind of switching back and forth happening regularly, then they may say, OK, the next reconsideration request, we will just wait a while to see what they actually want to do. But with I would say normal websites, where, after a couple of years, you just remove the disavow file because you think it's no longer relevant anymore, your website is in a new clean state,
