#SearchOfftheRecord



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=0) |  JOHN MUELLER: All right. Welcome, everyone, to

the first episode of "Search Off the Record," a podcast that we're trying out a little bit to see how we can bring across some more information from behind the scenes from the Google Search side. So my name is John Mueller. I am a Webmaster Trends Analyst or Search relations  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=30) |  person at Google, together with Gary and

Martin, who are also part of the Search Relations team. And our plan is to talk a little bit about how things are working behind the scenes, maybe to have some fun along the way as well. So what's been happening on your side, Gary? GARY ILLYES: Nothing really. JOHN MUELLER: Nothing, OK. Martin, anything happening on your side? MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah, actually I'm  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=60) |  really happy that we are recording the

podcast now, even though we don't have pop filters yet, because we ordered them but then the supplier couldn't meet the deadline. So this popcast is probably going to pop a little more. GARY ILLYES: Pop. JOHN MUELLER: Pop. OK, cool. GARY ILLYES: On the bright side, I have never said "Mary Poppins" so often. MARTIN SPLITT: That pops. Very nice pop culture reference. So yeah, I'm wondering when we get a follow-up on the pop  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=90) |  filter situation so that we hopefully have

pop filters for the next episode. Speaking of following things-- GARY ILLYES: Oh, no. JOHN MUELLER: I know that recently, yeah, there was a little bit of a conversation happening on Twitter, Gary. No? GARY ILLYES: I mean nofollow is always a topic in one part of the world or the internet, and it's fine. It's a big topic. It's something that many people are passionate about for various reasons. And we are asked about it quite a bit, and we had two dates announced--  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=120) |  not the fruit but unit of measurement

of time. And one was I think September 1, which was when we could have potentially used nofollow in our ranking algorithms. And then the second date was March 1, I think, which was when we allowed ourselves to use nofollow in crawling and indexing.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=150) |  And the question typically is whether we

started using any of those or in any of those fields, and we don't really have anything to announce still. We are working on a few things that will be helpful, I think, for the web and also probably helpful for webmasters. Think along the lines of-- what would be a good example? Like you have those sites that can, for example, redirect  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=180) |  to the new site when they move,

and they just leave up a link saying, visit us on our new site, and often those links are nofollowed. And it would be very helpful for example for us to follow those links and essentially help webmasters have their new sites discovered much faster. And we are also thinking about, well, other things, really. But yeah, I really don't want to name those things because they  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=210) |  might actually not happen at all, and

it might just turn out bad. But if you think about it, those nofollow links could be very, very helpful for discovering malicious sites, for example, the ones that force downloads and whatnot, or spam even, I guess. So yeah, I think nofollow links could be helpful, but we just don't have anything yet to say about how we use them. MARTIN SPLITT: But you're trying things out? GARY ILLYES: Yes, I am.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=240) |  MARTIN SPLITT: Cool. GARY ILLYES: Actually working

on, I think, three projects, like subprojects or whatever, trying to see if it would make sense to actually use nofollow in those cases. And I know that one of our ranking leaders actually asked us, if we get to lunch with one of the projects, then we should announce it publicly. So if we are going to launch with at least one  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=270) |  of these things, then you are going

to know about it publicly, because we kind of have to announce it. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. It sounds like this is more to, on the one hand, catch errors that people are making on the website and to be able to understand the problematic parts of the web a little bit better, and it's less something that people will need to optimize. Like if you have an existing website,  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=300) |  you don't need to think about this

if you're doing those parts correct already, right? GARY ILLYES: Exactly. Like with the changes that we announced, you already don't have to do anything. Like you can help us with the new rel attributes if you want to, and those could be helpful for training machine learning models, for example. I'm definitely not saying that we are doing that, but it could be helpful. But you really don't have to do anything. This was always an optional thing for everybody.  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=330) |  It's good to see that people still

adopted them. Like rel sponsored is used on millions of sites already even though we just said that, really, you don't have to, only if you want to. And they were just like, yeah, sure, why not. So it's kind of cool. Yeah. It was an exciting project. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. Yeah, I think what I find fascinating about the nofollow changes is that like we introduced these in response  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=360) |  to things that we found on the

web, which were a bit problematic, and now the web has evolved. And we've been able to kind of change these things as well because the rest of the web has been moving forward at such a nice pace, so I think that's really cool. GARY ILLYES: Yeah. The other thing that I found interesting when we were working with the leads on the nofollow change, the initial announcement, was that I briefly talked to other search engines about it. And pretty much all of them were like, well,  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=390) |  we've been doing this for a very

long time. And it turned out that we were the only ones who don't do it. That was kind of funny. JOHN MUELLER: Oh, man. OK. [SOUND EFFECT] GARY ILLYES: And I'm starting a blog. JOHN MUELLER: A new blog. GARY ILLYES: A cooking blog, a blog. JOHN MUELLER: Oh, you're creating a site. OK, cool. GARY ILLYES: I am creating a site, and then I will know how to rank best. MARTIN SPLITT: Wow.  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=420) |  JOHN MUELLER: Oh my gosh. MARTIN SPLITT:

Gary's becoming a webmaster. GARY ILLYES: No, I'm becoming a [INAUDIBLE].. JOHN MUELLER: Oh my god. GARY ILLYES: No, wait. Well, both. JOHN MUELLER: So Spaghetti Experience Optimizer. GARY ILLYES: Yes, Japanese spaghetti optimizer. MARTIN SPLITT: Oh God. GARY ILLYES: You know it's very rude when you call those noodles spaghetti? Just FYI. It's kind of offensive. JOHN MUELLER: Oh, OK. GARY ILLYES: Just FYI. MARTIN SPLITT: Oh my goodness. JOHN MUELLER: OK, fine. Looking forward to your non-spaghetti recipes. GARY ILLYES: Thank you.

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=450) |  I was talking to Lizzie, Lizzie [INAUDIBLE],,

who is our tech writer on our team. And she brought up that we could just test the structure data that we published on the blog, like recipe markup and whatnot. And basically I would just give her access to whatever generates the HTML, and then she can go nuts on it and see what happens, whether I get better rankings or not. We shall see. MARTIN SPLITT: That's cool. JOHN MUELLER: That'd be cool.  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=480) |  MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah. JOHN MUELLER: I think

it's always tricky with a lot of these recommendations that we give to people. We obviously see how some sites are implementing them, but it would be really nice to be able to try them out ourselves so that we can talk a little bit more from a practical point of view rather than from a purely theoretical point of view. GARY ILLYES: Yeah. JOHN MUELLER: So that'll be cool. MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah, I mean, I did that recently with the tests for figuring out how we are parsing structured data that  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=510) |  was generated by JavaScript. And I think

like the things that I noticed and where the team went oh, interesting, we should definitely practice a lot more of these things. JOHN MUELLER: OK. GARY ILLYES: Yeah. JOHN MUELLER: So does it work, JavaScript with structured data? MARTIN SPLITT: Yes. Yeah, that works. There's documentation on the website for this. I will be talking a little bit more about that soonish, but all of it is documented. It just doesn't work in the Structured Data Testing Tool,  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=540) |  but as long as you use like

the Rich Results Test, for instance, or Search Console, it works fine. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. GARY ILLYES: Is the discovery of the structure data delayed because first we have to render? MARTIN SPLITT: Not really, because we're pretty much rendering any page anyways, and the render queue median time is, like, 5 seconds, so normally that isn't a significant delay. However, if you are talking about Google Shopping, that is different because in the Google Merchant Center, they are trying to not render as long as they can.  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=570) |  Like basically, they look at the HTML

first, and then only if they don't find the information they are looking for, only then they render. So if you are doing e-commerce, it is a little different, but for Search itself, that's not a problem. GARY ILLYES: Interesting. JOHN MUELLER: And you can make your site a JavaScript site, Gary, single page app with non-spaghetti recipes. MARTIN SPLITT: You can read spaghetti code. GARY ILLYES: No, really no. I really don't like JavaScript. Sorry, Martin.  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=600) |  MARTIN SPLITT: Gary, how dare you? GARY

ILLYES: I'm actually not sorry. MARTIN SPLITT: I demand a Japanese dessert. GARY ILLYES: Sure, come pick it up. MARTIN SPLITT: Yes. JOHN MUELLER: Why don't you like JavaScript, Gary? Let it out. GARY ILLYES: I think if I start letting it out, then suddenly this podcast becomes R-rated, so I would rather not. I just don't like it, really. Like I have the same thing with, for example, Go. I also don't like Go. MARTIN SPLITT: You're just old school, Gary. GARY ILLYES: I like C++. I can like Python.  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=630) |  MARTIN SPLITT: What? GARY ILLYES: Yeah. MARTIN

SPLITT: Over Go? GARY ILLYES: Yeah. MARTIN SPLITT: How dare you? GARY ILLYES: Oh, yeah. MARTIN SPLITT: How dare you? JOHN MUELLER: OK. GARY ILLYES: But not Python 3. JOHN MUELLER: So you'll use tables in your site's design? GARY ILLYES: I will only use tables. JOHN MUELLER: Tables, OK. GARY ILLYES: Yeah, they are very good for ranking. JOHN MUELLER: I guess you have to put your dishes on tables anyway, right? GARY ILLYES: Yeah, putting this aside. JOHN MUELLER: OK, putting it aside, moving forward fairly quickly, we launched a whole bunch of speed metrics.  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=660) |  MARTIN SPLITT: Yay. GARY ILLYES: Whoo-hoo. JOHN

MUELLER: It seems like there are lots of these metrics out there. I don't know, Martin. Can you give us a quick rundown on what's all involved with these new speed metrics? MARTIN SPLITT: Oh, OK. GARY ILLYES: And just for the record, I would also appreciate that because I don't understand it. MARTIN SPLITT: So it has been a longstanding, ongoing effort to understand how to measure performance in the sense of performance for the user, right. So what is a good fast website, what  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=690) |  is a not so good, not so

fast website from a user's perspective? Now, that is surprisingly hard because there are so many things that you can potentially look at. And the first thing we had like 10 years ago was to look at how fast does the server actually respond with the data. And that's not a good metric because we have a lot of websites that are not just a bunch of HTML and images and videos and whatnot that need to be transferred from the server to the client, but we also have situations where you deliver  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=720) |  the initial HTML, you deliver a bunch

of JavaScript, and then the JavaScript has to generate all the content. So the server responds within, like, less than a second. The network has the data in, let's say, like 1.2 seconds so that the browser has everything it needs within 1.2 seconds, let's say, but the page is still blank because the JavaScript needs to be executed. It needs to create all the content, and then that metric became relatively useless, because the server response time didn't say anything  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=750) |  about how fast the page was to

the user. So then we looked at, OK, so maybe we can try to find out when do we start actually painting content. So when does the page that you see in your browser start to not be just a white window? That is what we call the First Contentful Paint. And that is definitely helpful, and that was what we used the last couple of years. But we figured that's not helpful either because when you start painting, let's say, like a little bit of text,  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=780) |  but this website is about images and

the images only pop in like 5 seconds later, then that's still a slow website. So that's not helpful either. So maybe we need to find out where most of the content is visible, so that's the Largest Contentful Paint, like what's the moment when most of the content is actually user-consumable, visible to the user. That's helpful, but that's still not the entire picture. Because if it's not just a website like Wikipedia, or even if it's just a website like Wikipedia,  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=810) |  you want to probably also scroll and

interact with the content. Like you click buttons, you click on links, you click on whatnot. And the fact that we paint this quickly on screen doesn't actually mean that you can interact with it. And you oftentimes see that. The website looks like it's there. You click on the link, nothing happens. You click again, you click again, you click again, and then after like 5 seconds, it actually does the thing that you did. Or there's like a dropdown and you click on it and nothing happens. That's frustrating, so we needed to figure out  

#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=840) |  how to measure that and expose that

as a measurable metric. That is what the First Input Delay is for. So now we can tell when the website starts to become interactive for the user. That's great too, but then there's one more thing that is very, very annoying. It's my pet peeve to be annoyed about this. We have a website that shows you the thing you want and there is a link that you want to click on, and you tap that link, and then something else loads.  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=870) |  Most of the time it's actually ads,

but sometimes it's also just like the image loads or something like that. And then the link moves down and something else is in the space where I clicked now. And now I click on this completely unrelated thing because I didn't actually do anything. I tapped on something. It wasn't interactive at that point, and then when it becomes interactive, there's different content there. And what happens then is that I click on something completely unrelated without actually wanting it, and then I get taken to another page.  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3Ofp48EJxrU/maxres2.jpg)



#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=900) |  And I'm like, ah, I didn't want

to be here. Why did that happen? How did that happen? And that was very, very hard to find out or quantify as a metric. I mean, as a user, you see it. You tap on something. It moves. You tap on something else that is in its place now. You get annoyed. But how do you measure that? How do you quantify that into a number or a time or something like that? And we recently did that as a new metric called Cumulative Layout Shifting or Shift, and the frustration  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=930) |  or the challenge for webmasters was that

as we develop these new metrics, it became a little unclear what to look out for. There were so many different metrics. There was Speed Index at some point. There was First Contentful Paint, First Meaningful Paint. A bunch of metrics were designed to better understand and reflect what user performance looks like or website performance from a user's perspective looks like. And we have been changing our understanding  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=960) |  of that quite irregularly, so it was

relatively hard to figure out, which metrics should I actually be looking at this point in time. So someone who has optimized for Speed Index, which was a very old metric to model how performance from a user's perspective looks like, they would optimize for that and then find out, once they have invested all the time to actually make their website appear fast in that metric, that this metric was no longer used. And that was frustrating, to say the least. So we came up with this idea of coming up  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=990) |  with Core Web Vitals, so basically a

set of metrics that is our best current understanding of what a measurably fast website looks like, and we understand that, A, this is an ongoing process. We do see new things happen on the web, and they shape the way that the web works differently, which means that also you measure performance differently. And we are still not fully understanding or quantifying  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1020) |  the user performance perfectly, so we need

to iterate on this on one hand. On the other hand, we want to give as clear as possible of a guidance to users and webmasters alike to figure out what is a fast and good website. So how do we reconcile this? On one hand, we need to iterate the metrics. On one on the other hand, we want as stable as possible a metrics set for users and webmasters to look for. And we came up with Core Web Vitals  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1050) |  saying that we would update them roughly

on a yearly basis. And the first iteration of that is three metrics-- the First Input Delay that I already discussed, the Largest Contentful Paint that I discussed as well, and the Cumulative Layout Shifting. These three metrics are basically the current model of what we consider a fast website or a measurably fast website. This isn't perfect, but this is the best we have at this point.  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1080) |  And we're going to revisit this set

of metrics next year and probably iterate on it as well. But we will communicate up front before we make any changes. And we use these metrics to give developers guidance to say, OK, my website is objectively set, measurably set, fast or not so fast or terribly slow, to then iterate on their own websites. We can also use these metrics in other places. Like, Lighthouse uses it to score your website.  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1110) |  PageSpeed Insights uses it. There's a Chrome

extension that shows you how a website is doing in terms of these three metrics. There's a bunch of APIs in the browser that allow you to measure these things for yourself and maybe log them or something. So there's a bunch of tooling for webmasters available now that helps them figure out how fast their website is in the eyes of the user, and currently it's these three metrics. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. GARY ILLYES: And if you were ever wondering if Martin can have an 8-minute long monologue,  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1140) |  yes, he can. MARTIN SPLITT: I can.

I could have spoken longer, but I just wanted to be as clear as possible. JOHN MUELLER: As fast, I guess. GARY ILLYES: Minute four, I was about to jump in and just say something funny, and I was like, no, let's see how long he can go on. MARTIN SPLITT: Eight minutes is the current maximum. JOHN MUELLER: That was really cool. OK. So on the one hand, getting back to Gary's fascination about JavaScript, it sounds like a lot of this is based on websites that do fancy stuff in the browser. MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah.  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1170) |  JOHN MUELLER: Would that be correct? Like

if you have a static HTML site, does that mean like everything loads instantly and you can interact with it right away, and nothing shifts around? MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah, no, that's the thing. So of course, JavaScript is the biggest culprit here, but you can also screw it up with HTML. So for instance, if you have super huge images, that-- if you are a photographer, you probably want to upload the highest possible quality and then you just put these images in, and you just make them look small in the browser. But the browser has to actually download the full, I don't know, like 20-megapixel image,  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1200) |  which is like multiple floppy disks in

size. Then your website would probably be like-- GARY ILLYES: Why would I want to download floppy disks? Like, who downloads floppy disks, Martin? How old are you? MARTIN SPLITT: You wouldn't download a car. I actually would. No, I think floppy disk is just such an archaic medium at this point, and it's such a reasonable size. And when I see like people are throwing 10 megabyte images on me-- and I'm like, that's like seven floppy disks.  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1230) |  What are you doing? Because I remember

the times where you would install a game and going like, insert floppy disk 12 out of 15. So yeah, I'm old, but still young at heart. But yeah, so if you have like super huge images on your website and you force the browser to download them, then you might actually run into situations like the Cumulative Layout Shift, where the image isn't showing up yet. I click on a link and then the image loads, and then somehow another link is in its place. And then I click on that accidentally.  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1260) |  And so you can run into these

problems without actually using JavaScript. It's just less likely. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. So, Gary, if you're going to put any photos on your blog, it sounds like you need to watch out for this too. And I guess if you don't measure those metrics, I'm sure Martin will run those tests for you. MARTIN SPLITT: Lighthouse. I'll run all the Lighthouse tests. GARY ILLYES: Martin sucks. JOHN MUELLER: No. This is fantastic. GARY ILLYES: Martin hates me. MARTIN SPLITT: No, I don't. I really, really like you, Gary, and you don't like that.  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1290) |  GARY ILLYES: That's true. JOHN MUELLER: But

I'm sure those non-spaghetti recipes will be good and fast. Like, will you make them so that they're fast to cook, not just fast to load, or does the cooking speed not reflect quality? MARTIN SPLITT: It's not a Web Vital yet. GARY ILLYES: What? Like, just what? MARTIN SPLITT: Gary, just cook spaghetti but not write spaghetti code. You will be good. [LAUGHTER] [SOUND EFFECT] JOHN MUELLER: So how is life in kind of the pandemic times  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1320) |  of corona? How is it treating you

guys? Are you coping? Are you getting all your work done, working faster, more efficiently, now that you don't have distractions like cooks that bring you food? MARTIN SPLITT: Gary cooks. GARY ILLYES: I don't bring food. You have to come here and pick it up. You have to come to Gary Will and pick up your own food. I'm actually cooking for, I think, seven people plus Martin. MARTIN SPLITT: Because I'm not people.  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3Ofp48EJxrU/maxres3.jpg)



#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1350) |  JOHN MUELLER: Wow. GARY ILLYES: You're like

a unicorn or something. MARTIN SPLITT: Oh. JOHN MUELLER: So why are you eating food for seven people, Gary? GARY ILLYES: No, this is, like, just-- OK, just geez. JOHN MUELLER: OK. GARY ILLYES: I'm actually losing weight. JOHN MUELLER: Wow. OK. MARTIN SPLITT: Yes, he is. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I saw a lot of your recipe photos on Twitter. They look really cool. GARY ILLYES: It's not recipe photos. It's food photos, but sure. You don't see the recipes. JOHN MUELLER: OK, fine. I just saw the end result. On Twitter,  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1380) |  it's always hard to judge, like, does

this just look good or is this actually something that will taste good, but again, I trust you. GARY ILLYES: True, It depends. That's actually interesting, and it depends. That's the easiest answer, as with many things in SEO, because now cooking is also SEO. So I have some experimental-- like, my father was a chef. And what we did in the kitchen was lots of experimentation because he had to experiment, and we hated it.  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1410) |  But I also do the same thing,

and now I kind of understand his fascination with experimentation in the kitchen. And sometimes my food comes out pretty much inedible, even though I can present pretty much anything really nice. And then other times, I just spend, like, five minutes on a dish, like sugachi-based soba or sugachi soba. And it doesn't take more than five minutes to make, and it tastes heavenly.  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1440) |  So yeah, it depends. JOHN MUELLER: It

depends. Oh my god, it's almost like you can use that for non-SEO answers as well. So awesome. GARY ILLYES: Yeah, we should make a challenge. Use "it depends" more. JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. Martin, what do you think? MARTIN SPLITT: I think it depends, but I think we can totally do that. Depending on the situation, you can definitely use a depends as an answer. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. So how is that working for you, Martin? MARTIN SPLITT: Ah, it's a mixed bag. It depends, actually. It depends on when you ask me.  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1470) |  So most of the time, I'm doing

relatively well. I use the opportunity that I'm more at home to do more virtual events, which aren't as great. I mean, it depends-- oh god. It depends on the event. You don't get the same feedback. You don't get the same interaction with the audience as you do in an in-person event, but I think it's still OK to do this, especially as we are all  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1500) |  at home. I do Twitch streams, which

is quite cool. So I had a doc draft-- actually, the one for JavaScript Unstructured Data. I had the draft pretty much ready and then just were mulling over a few phrases and a few ways of formulating things, and I was just putting it into the Twitch stream. And then people were giving feedback and asking questions, and based on that, I was able to improve the draft even more. So that was kind of cool, so this collaborative side of things. But I'm planning a few more virtual events  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1530) |  that are a little different from the

normal one person talking, everyone listening kind of situation, because I think that translates really badly to online, but hey. We do have the Webmaster Lightning Talks, so that's pretty cool. I do go biking a lot, so that's nice. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah, I don't know. But some days it's just not great. Let's put it that way. Yesterday, I had a bit of a meltdown, kind of, but I'm fine today. JOHN MUELLER: Cool, OK. Glad to hear that it's better.  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1560) |  I don't know. For me, not interacting

with the bigger office or people that you see when you travel to work-- I don't know. I find that really hard to adjust to, but I mean, we've been doing this for a while now. It's not completely new. MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah. JOHN MUELLER: I think the times that really get to me are more on the weekends where it's like, well, I've spent all day or all week at the office. And then on the weekend, I'm essentially still  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1590) |  in the office. I mean, technically it's

like, maybe I'm not in front of this computer, but I'm 5 meters over to the side. But it's still like all the same place, all the same stuff. So yeah, I don't know. Like you, some days it works well. Some days, it doesn't work well. I think in general, there'll be some things that hopefully we'll be kind of able to keep doing. But it would really be nice to get back to the office and see people in person and kind of fight for meeting rooms  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1620) |  and all of the-- the things that

you thought were frustrating are kind of just the, I don't know, different things happening all the time. It'd be cool. MARTIN SPLITT: It spices up the life, kind of. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. GARY ILLYES: Yeah. I think a change in setting can be very helpful, or so I found. MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah. GARY ILLYES: Like yesterday, I went out and had coffee at my favorite bistro, and I was just sitting there watching people pass by.  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1650) |  And I was basically learning to lipread

because the waiter was, like, a kilometer away from the table. So for the people who use imperial units, 1 kilometer is about 3,333 caterpillars, just to put in perspective for you. I calculated this yesterday. So I'm actually fairly certain about that number.  

#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1680) |  Oh, it's brown caterpillars. It's not any

kind of caterpillars. MARTIN SPLITT: I was about to ask which kind of caterpillars. GARY ILLYES: Yeah. JOHN MUELLER: OK. GARY ILLYES: And I found that super helpful, just like getting out of the house and just sitting somewhere where you can see people pass by. Like, you don't interact with them and you are quite far away from them. It was really nice. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I think that's kind of the lucky situation we're in here in Switzerland and probably not the same for everyone else. Like, some people are interacting more,  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1710) |  some people are kind of isolating more.

It's like, ah. GARY ILLYES: Yeah. JOHN MUELLER: It's still going to be a long time. But on the other hand, a long time means a lot of podcasts from us. MARTIN SPLITT: That's true. GARY ILLYES: So exciting. I'm uncomfortably excited. JOHN MUELLER: So cool. All right. I think we'll continue to do these and try these out. It will be great to have feedback from anyone that happens to be listening to this. Let us know which kind of things you enjoyed, what kind of things maybe we could do differently,  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1740) |  if you liked the podcast. And of

course, give us a link or a thumbs up. GARY ILLYES: Just make it nofollow. JOHN MUELLER: A nofollow link. GARY ILLYES: Yes. JOHN MUELLER: So are you saying the nofollow link would count just as well? GARY ILLYES: Don't read too much into it. Just give us a nofollow link. JOHN MUELLER: OK, give us a nofollow link, and point other people to the podcast so that they can listen to it as well. The podcast should be on all kinds of the usual podcast platforms where you can get podcasts. So subscribe to the podcast, watch out for the next ones,  

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1770) |  and hopefully, if all goes well, we'll

continue to do these on a fairly regular basis. GARY ILLYES: Especially now that we are stuck at home. MARTIN SPLITT: Yep. JOHN MUELLER: Yep, and maybe next time we'll have pop filters and-- MARTIN SPLITT: Pop music. GARY ILLYES: Pop filters. JOHN MUELLER: I mean, if they're pop filters, then we can't do pop music. MARTIN SPLITT: But we can do pop culture references. JOHN MUELLER: I'm actually in the red when I say pop filters. MARTIN SPLITT: I just noticed the same, yeah. JOHN MUELLER: Wow.  

#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ofp48EJxrU&t=1800) |  MARTIN SPLITT: Pop. GARY ILLYES: Well, our

producer will kill me, but that's fine. JOHN MUELLER: OK, so maybe we should take a break here. Thank you guys for joining in. Thank you to everyone who is listening to this, who's linking to this with a nofollow link, of course. And hope to see you all again in one of the future episodes. GARY ILLYES: Yeah, yeah, yeah. MARTIN SPLITT: Bye-bye. JOHN MUELLER: Bye. GARY ILLYES: Have a day. [MUSIC PLAYING]
