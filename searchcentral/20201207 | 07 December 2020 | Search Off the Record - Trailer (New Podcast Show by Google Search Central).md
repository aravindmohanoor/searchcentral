#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuVYWUsLfE&t=0) |  [MUSIC PLAYING] JOHN MUELLER: I'm John here

from Google Zurich. MARTIN SPLITT: I'm Martin, also from Google Zurich. GARY ILLYES: And [? I ?] [? was ?] Gary. JOHN MUELLER: This is a new podcast series that we're trying out to try to give some behind-the-scenes insights into what goes on at Google when it comes to search and all of the communications around search. Our goal is not to be another source of documentation,

information about-- MARTIN SPLITT: --what's on our minds. So in this podcast, we are trying to share a little bit with everyone who's interested in what we are thinking and working on and what happens before things become public, basically. So, like, little bits and pieces from our daily work, as well as things we discover at events and on Twitter. A mixed bag, really. JOHN MUELLER: I kind of like the name "Search Off the Record," because it's a lot of the stuff

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuVYWUsLfE&t=60) |  that we do that is not documented

or kind of some of the information that leads to what we ended up documenting in the end, which is kind of fun. Also, for some reason, it is recorded, but not on records. So technically we're OK, right? MARTIN SPLITT: Mm-hmm. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah? MARTIN SPLITT: We are safe. GARY ILLYES: Also, we had other ideas for the names. And it's probably great that we chose this name, because others were, like, "Search Engine Square Table." [CHUCKLING]  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuVYWUsLfE&t=90) |  JOHN MUELLER: That would have been awkward,

Gary. I don't know. MARTIN SPLITT: It's good we tabled that. JOHN MUELLER: That's good, yeah. GARY ILLYES: Martin, stop it. JOHN MUELLER: We should have searched for a better name. MARTIN SPLITT: On the search engine of your choice. GARY ILLYES: So why you should listen to our podcast? Well, primarily because we are really, really funny. Secondarily, because we have information that you don't have, and you want that information badly. Because we talk about sofas, for example, and we talk about coffee, occasionally. Well, actually, almost always.

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuVYWUsLfE&t=120) |  JOHN MUELLER: And robots.txt. GARY ILLYES: And

robots.txt. JOHN MUELLER: Are we going to talk about secret algorithms at Google? Is a sofa a ranking signal? MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah, absolutely. JOHN MUELLER: Well, this is "Search Off the Record." And now we're still on the record. But I guess we will continue to be on the record until we say something terrible enough for someone to just either stop the recording or fire us, whichever comes first. SPEAKER: Should I stop the recording? GARY ILLYES: Perhaps, please. [LAUGHTER] MARTIN SPLITT: Make it stop.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AuVYWUsLfE&t=150) |  [MUSIC PLAYING] JOHN MUELLER: So what would

you choose as your user agent, Martin? MARTIN SPLITT: "Pink Fluffy Unicorn 1.0." GARY ILLYES: Fluffy. So fluffy. [GIGGLING]
