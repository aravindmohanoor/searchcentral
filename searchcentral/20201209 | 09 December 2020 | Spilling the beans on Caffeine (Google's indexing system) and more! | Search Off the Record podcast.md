Search Off the Record is a podcast series that takes you behind the scenes of Google Search with John Mueller, Gary Illyes, and Martin Splitt from the Search Relations team.



#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=0) |  [MUSIC PLAYING] JOHN MUELLER: Welcome, everyone, to

the next episode of "Search Off the Record," a podcast that we're trying out. Our plan is to talk a bit about what's happening at Google Search, how things work behind the scenes, and maybe have some fun along the way. My name is John Mueller. I am a Search Advocate on the Search Relations team here at Google in Switzerland.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=30) |  And I'm joined here today by Martin

and Gary, who are also on the Search Relations team. We've done a number of episodes now, and I think we're kind of getting a hang of it, but it's still all kind of exciting and cool and awkward sometimes. But anyway, lots of cool stuff happening, and I hope you enjoy this episode. Martin, do you want to take us off? MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah, sure. Sure, why not. I was on vacation recently, and while I was on vacation,  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=60) |  we announced a cool new thing that

we have been working on for quite a while, which is the Virtual Webmaster Conference. And I was really, really surprised, because one of the things that I was worried about upfront was the fact that I knew it would be a very different format. And I was like, no one's going to join that. But that's not what happened. It filled up really, really quickly. That was wild. I'm not sure how the event's going to go. John, what's going to happen if the event goes wrong and doesn't go the way that we expected it to go?  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=90) |  Will this be OK? JOHN MUELLER: It'll

be OK, Martin. Don't worry. I think-- I mean, by the time this episode is live, we'll know how it went. But in general, it's good to try things out. And I think especially when it comes to online events, people have tried various things already. And some people are kind of tired of the traditional things, so doing something different and taking a risk, trying something new out, I think that's fantastic. MARTIN SPLITT: I really, really hope that it goes well. Because I kind of miss-- as you say,  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=120) |  there's so many virtual events out there,

and most of them are just like some speakers talking to you and you are watching them. And I'm like, yeah, this could be a YouTube video. This doesn't have to be a live event. So I'm hoping that we get some nice outcomes from the discussions and panels and feedback sessions. GARY ILLYES: Can we fire him if the event doesn't go well? JOHN MUELLER: No, no, no. GARY ILLYES: Oh. MARTIN SPLITT: Aw. GARY ILLYES: Bummer. MARTIN SPLITT: Sorry. Sorry, Gary. You don't get rid of me that easily. JOHN MUELLER: Ha ha! MARTIN SPLITT: Also, if it goes well, I think we will definitely turn it into a series. We can definitely run these multiple times  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=150) |  and with different things. People have asked

me, oh, can you record it? Can we listen in? And I'm like, no, I don't think that makes sense, but maybe we can try that with later events. Just not in this pilot. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. And I think one of the things we also notice is there's just such a high demand for any kind of event from our side. And I think the big takeaway we picked up there, also, is that we kind of need to do something more traditional along the way, too. MARTIN SPLITT: Definitely.  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=180) |  JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. So I don't know

exactly how we'll do that. I think timing-wise, we'll aim more towards end of the year so that we have a bit of time to get everything organized, to make sure that we have everything set up properly for the speakers, that we have sessions that are interesting and setups that are a little bit, I hope, interactive, and where we can get some feedback from people beforehand and maybe along the way as we go in there. MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah. JOHN MUELLER: It's like, what kind of sessions  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=210) |  do you think we should do there,

Martin? Do you have any ideas? MARTIN SPLITT: I would love to have some sort of maybe Q&A panel. I think these are very, very useful. I think your site clinics are generally also super useful. I'm guessing that we have probably new things to communicate, so the classical front-centric sessions, where we have a talk, is probably also a good idea. What I'm wondering about is-- so on one hand, I want to make sure that we are not limiting capacity, because people don't like that.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=240) |  And I think the beauty of virtual

events is that we don't have to limit capacity. But then we have to figure out how we can mix the interactive parts with the less interactive parts, and with the non-interactive things, like the regular talks, I prefer them prerecorded, to be honest. I don't know, how do you feel about prerecording and screening with a live chat, like we do with Webmaster Lightning Talks? Or do you prefer live presentations, as in live-live? JOHN MUELLER: I kind of like both. I think for information rich talks,  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=270) |  doing something prerecorded makes it a little

bit easier, because then you have a chance to really fine-tune the message and to bring it across in a way that is easier to understand, where you can match your slides, maybe, if you're doing slides as well. But the live-live talks, I think what's interesting there is just, it's a whole different energy. Because you have all of this pressure and adrenaline  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=300) |  from doing something live, which means it's

not perfect, but it also, I think, brings across a little bit more the kind of human touch when it comes to content. So especially for Q&A, for maybe a small panel or something like that, doing something live, I think, is pretty cool. Doing some of that in a chat format is also an option. I kind of like the video for live as well.  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=330) |  But sometimes chat works just as well.

And especially considering that not everyone speaks English as a first language, then sometimes having something written makes it a little bit easier to understand what is actually happening. MARTIN SPLITT: Definitely. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. MARTIN SPLITT: And you can also get transcriptions for the videos and stuff, that that makes prerecording a good option. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, and I think if it's recorded, it makes it a little bit easier for the different time zones. But anything interactive, we still  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=360) |  have to figure out how we deal

with the time zones there. So if people from Asia are interested in joining in or want to listen in live, does that mean they have to get up in the middle of the night? Or could we do something that's spread out a little bit more? I don't know. MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah, that's a good question. Maybe we could do a two-day event, one in one time zone and then the other in the other time zone, but it's similar content? I don't know.  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=390) |  We'll have to figure this one out.

That's going to be interesting. JOHN MUELLER: Or we could just do it as a podcast. Then we don't have to worry about the video format at all. GARY ILLYES: I approve of this idea. MARTIN SPLITT: Of course, yeah. Because Gary, we want you on video, but you really, really don't want to get on video, huh? GARY ILLYES: That is correct, sir. MARTIN SPLITT: But your class on how Search works was so good. I would love this content to be more widely available. And I know that you are OK with being on stage in person, just not on video, right? GARY ILLYES: So we were actually talking  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=420) |  about this with our producer, with Anna,

but I really want to do it properly, not from a home recording, but in a studio. And we have-- well, Anna has ideas about how to make it happen. But-- MARTIN SPLITT: You will be on camera? GARY ILLYES: But when we have a studio. And I would be on camera-- basically, if it's worth it, then I can deal with being on camera. But for events, for example, I just feel so awkward about it that I just don't want to do it.  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=450) |  If someone tricks me into being on

camera, like for example, there was this, air quotes, "podcast" the other week where I was invited to talk on a podcast-- again, air quotes. And then when I joined in into the meeting, then they started recording the video feed. And I'm like, hang on. Like, what's happening? And what do you mean, what's happening? It's like, I thought this is a podcast. It's like, well, it's actually a webcast.  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=480) |  Like, what does that mean? It's like,

you are recording me? Yeah, could you also change your T-shirt, because it's like you're in a home T-shirt. But like, don't you think you should have told me this before? MARTIN SPLITT: Oh, my. GARY ILLYES: So yeah. Like, I will not cancel on the spot, because, I don't know, I feel that it's unprofessional. But yeah, that was kind of awkward, and not something that I would prefer to repeat. But if we have a studio and we have our producer and her ideas, then I'm  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=510) |  very happy to do it for something

like Life of a Query or How Search Works, or whatever it's called externally. MARTIN SPLITT: That is fantastic news. JOHN MUELLER: So Gary, since we're in a podcast format now, would you be interested in going through some of those details around how search works, how indexing works, here? GARY ILLYES: What kind of question is that? MARTIN SPLITT: Tell us a little more about indexing, Gary. Come on, let's do it. GARY ILLYES: Man, I wish I could,  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=540) |  but I really don't want to. JOHN

MUELLER: You should do it. MARTIN SPLITT: Tough luck, buttercup, you have to. Let's do it. GARY ILLYES: Well, it's kind of-- well-- fine. OK. MARTIN SPLITT: Let's talk about Caffeine. [CHUCKLING] GARY ILLYES: Actually, that's a good topic, because there was some confusion about that on Twitter as well. So maybe I can shed a light or two on that topic. Actually, we could do a breakdown of Caffeine on these podcasts. JOHN MUELLER: OK. MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah. GARY ILLYES: We should? OK, let's do that. So yeah, we have Caffeine.  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=570) |  That's our indexing system. Only externally it's

called Caffeine. Internally, it has some other name, but that doesn't really matter. And it does many, many things. And I think that's actually not very clear externally, that it does many things. For people, it's just like, we have the crawler, which is Googlebot and then that goes to something something Google magic. Well, people know that it gets rendered, and then something something Google magic, and then we have an index. Now, we can actually break down that Google magic.  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=600) |  And people in general know that Google

magic, or could figure it out if they wanted to. But that Google magic is essentially what Caffeine is doing-- basically ingesting, picking up whatever is produced by Googlebot, which is a protocol buffer-- you can look it up on your favorite search engine what a protocol buffer is. And then that protocol buffer is picked up by Caffeine,  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=630) |  and then we collect signals, blah blah

blah. And then we add the information that Caffeine produced into our index. Now, what's happening inside Caffeine? Well, the very first step is that protocol buffer ingestion, basically picks up the protocol buffer and starts processing it. The very first step after ingestion is conversion. MARTIN SPLITT: What does that mean? GARY ILLYES: Well, it's conversion. Basically, it converts, right? MARTIN SPLITT: What to what?  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=660) |  GARY ILLYES: Do you have problem with

the word or? MARTIN SPLITT: No, I'm just like, OK, we have a protocol buffer, which has all the information that it needs. What does it convert there? GARY ILLYES: OK, so-- MARTIN SPLITT: Does it convert the protocol buffer into a different format, or-- GARY ILLYES: Well, that too. But first, we have to, for example, normalize the HTML. MARTIN SPLITT: Uh-huh. GARY ILLYES: Because as you may have heard, or noticed, the internet is generally broken, HTML-wise. But we still try to make sense of it. Now, if you have really broken HTML,  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=690) |  then that's kind of hard, so we

push all the HTML through an HTML lexer-- again, search for the name. You can figure out what that is. But basically, we normalize the HTML. And then it's much easier to process it. And then, there comes the [? hotstepper, ?] H1, H2, H3, H4. MARTIN SPLITT: [GASPS] GARY ILLYES: I know. All these header tags are also normalized. Through rendering, we try to understand the styling that  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=720) |  was applied on the H tags so

we can determine the relative importance of the H tags compared to each other. Let's see, what else we do there. JOHN MUELLER: Do we also convert things like PDFs, or-- GARY ILLYES: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. So Google Search can index many formats, not just text HTML. We can index PDFs, we can index spreadsheets, we can index Word document files, we can index--  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=750) |  what else? Lotus files, for some reason.

MARTIN SPLITT: Seriously? GARY ILLYES: Yeah. It's-- yeah, I know. [LAUGHTER] MARTIN SPLITT: Wow. GARY ILLYES: Yeah, it's-- MARTIN SPLITT: Can we index floppy disks? GARY ILLYES: What's your obsession with floppy disks? MARTIN SPLITT: I love them! They are such a beautiful medium. I wish they would come back. GARY ILLYES: No, they are not. They are actually the opposite of beautiful, whatever that is. MARTIN SPLITT: No! GARY ILLYES: It's like, they get corrupted just by, like-- literally, you blow some air on them, and they are corrupted. MARTIN SPLITT: But they are iconic, because they are the Save icon.  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=780) |  [LAUGHTER] GARY ILLYES: I-- I-- oh my

god. MARTIN SPLITT: I am so not sorry about this. OK, sorry. Yeah, so we convert these, we put out the HTML tokens, we normalize the HTML tree. GARY ILLYES: Wait, wait, wait. So going back to PDF. So PDF is a binary format. It's not that easy to process. So for that, as far as I remember, we license decoder from Adobe that we use to basically convert the PDF to HTML.  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=810) |  And then from there on, we are

just working with HTML. And this happens with all the other binary formats that we can index in web search. Of course, those are also normalized, so the HTML eventually will be very well formed. We then start looking at meta tags, because there are a few meta tags that we deeply care about. For example, the meta name robots-- JOHN MUELLER: Keywords. GARY ILLYES: No, not the keywords. We don't care about the meta keywords at all. Like, at all. JOHN MUELLER: Mm.  

#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=840) |  GARY ILLYES: I'm sorry. I'm not sorry.

I've changed my mind. But the meta name robots, that's something that we deeply care about. And for example, if we find with the value noindex, then we know that we have to stop processing that document, or at least don't put in the index. What else do we do here? Something that confuses some people is that if there are HTML body related elements inside the head tag--  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=870) |  MARTIN SPLITT: Like iframe. That belongs in

the body. GARY ILLYES: Like iframe or div or p or span or whatever, then the HTML lexer will close the head right before those texts and starts the body from thereon. And you can also look at this like how it works in practice on the W3C HTML validator, which will do something similar. But that's an important detail if you are injecting stuff in the head and you want stuff  

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=900) |  to be picked up from there. What

else we do here? I think that's pretty much-- that's it. One system that is related, kind of, to converter is something that we call the collapser, which is essentially the system that's doing error page handling. As we said previously, the internet is generally broken HTML-wise, also  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=930) |  HTTP-wise for some web servers. But we

still try to make sense of the internet. And one thing that is broken on the internet sometimes is error pages. For example, there might be Not Found page, 404 page, that comes back with an HTTP 200 status code. It's actually quite common. MARTIN SPLITT: Yep. GARY ILLYES: And what we call soft 404s. MARTIN SPLITT: Every single page app in the world has probably at some point ran into soft 404s.

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=960) |  GARY ILLYES: Oh, really? JOHN MUELLER: Oh

wait, you're saying we have to do this for JavaScript sites? MARTIN SPLITT: Not just for JavaScript, OK? Other people screw this up in different ways, too. GARY ILLYES: Are you saying that JavaScript sucks? MARTIN SPLITT: No, I'm saying people don't know how to use it without breaking the internet sometimes. GARY ILLYES: So JavaScript sucks, according to Martin Splitt. MARTIN SPLITT: No. How dare you, Gary. JOHN MUELLER: So you're saying JavaScript is an error page? OK. Continue. GARY ILLYES: Why am I even working with you people? [LAUGHS] It's like I should just--  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=990) |  agh! So going back to error pages,

which are generated by JavaScript. MARTIN SPLITT: Gary! [LAUGHS] GARY ILLYES: OK, OK, fine. Not every error page is generated by JavaScript, but some are. MARTIN SPLITT: Yes, thank you. GARY ILLYES: OK. Now that we have Martin's blessing, error pages. Soft error pages. We don't want those in our index, so we try to detect when they happen, when they show up in our processing pipelines, and that's what this error page handling thing does.  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1020) |  Basically, we have a very large corpus--

well, actually corpora-- of error pages, and then we try to match text against those. This can also lead to very funny bugs, I would say, where, for example, you are writing an article about error pages in general and you can't for your life get it indexed. And that's sometimes because our error page  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1050) |  handling systems misdetect your article based on

the keywords that you use as a soft error page. And basically, it prompts Caffeine to stop processing those pages. And of course, error page handling also works on other kinds of error pages, not just 404s. Like for example, if the server sends I'm overloaded message, HTML page, but the 200 status code, then we  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1080) |  might be able to understand that. We

have redirects that are not so obvious, and we can detect those as well. What else? We also try to detect login pages here. I'm not sure why is that useful, but we know about login pages. JOHN MUELLER: So with error pages, would we also count something like an e-commerce site that has a product out of stock? Would that be seen as a soft 404 page, or would we try to index that page anyway?  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1110) |  GARY ILLYES: I think generally, that would

depend on the words that you are using on the page. JOHN MUELLER: So should people try to hide that, then? Or is it-- GARY ILLYES: Well, I think this is a philosophical question. And I'm sure that there is someone on our team who's trying to figure this out, but in my opinion, you don't want out-of-stock pages in the index. So you would probably want to get rid of them. JOHN MUELLER: OK. GARY ILLYES: Again, I think it's a philosophical question,  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1140) |  because you can definitely provide some functionality

on the page so people can, I don't know, subscribe for updates about that product or something like that. And then it might become more useful, maybe, to have those pages in the index. But if you just have an out of stock page, like, why? MARTIN SPLITT: Mm. GARY ILLYES: Why would you want to do that? JOHN MUELLER: OK. MARTIN SPLITT: Questionable value there. GARY ILLYES: Except-- I have an idea-- except if you are trolling the users.  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1170) |  JOHN MUELLER: [LAUGHS] GARY ILLYES: Basically, you

are advertising that you have this product, but when they end up on your site, then it's like, ha-ha, just kidding. Out of stock. JOHN MUELLER: That doesn't seem very nice. Yeah, OK. So I guess the answer is, it depends. GARY ILLYES: It depends. MARTIN SPLITT: Mm-hmm. JOHN MUELLER: OK. GARY ILLYES: It's one of your favorite words, I know, or phrases. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. MARTIN SPLITT: It's the catch-all phrase, I think. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I think that's really tricky. Like, the out of stock situation is something that people--  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1200) |  when I talk about e-commerce, it always

comes up. It's like, how should we handle these? And it feels like on the one hand, you still want to be findable for some of these, especially if it's, like, a vintage item. Like, there was only one in the world and you no longer have it, but you have all of the documentation and all of that. Then you kind of want that to be findable. But if it's something that everyone else has and you just don't have on stock at the moment, then for the user,  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1230) |  it's more useful if they just go

to some shop that does have it. GARY ILLYES: Yeah. Yeah, I think this "it depends" phrase is very applicable here, and on many things in SEO. I know that people don't like it, but it's very useful and we should use it more. MARTIN SPLITT: It's true! GARY ILLYES: It's true, yes. MARTIN SPLITT: It is just most of the things depend on the context, yeah. JOHN MUELLER: Oh my gosh, we should use it more. OK, fine. [LAUGHS] So one of the places where I kind of ran into some  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1260) |  of these struggles with "it depends" myself

is when I had a friend who got in touch with me because they heard I was at Google and doing some stuff on Search. And of course, they have a website, and like, "could I just help them to make it number one" kind of question. But of course, I can't. It's like, I can't go there and give you that secret keyword meta tag that  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1290) |  will make you rank number one, because

Gary just said my secret doesn't work. The keyword meta tag. GARY ILLYES: Wait, the keyword meta tag is your secret? [LAUGHTER] Your secret sucks. I mean, everyone knows about it. JOHN MUELLER: Oh man. I thought we just tell people not to use it because it's one of those things that makes the magic happen, and we just don't want them to know about the magic. MARTIN SPLITT: No, that's the page rank meta tag. GARY ILLYES: Oh. [LAUGHTER] MARTIN SPLITT: Oops. GARY ILLYES: You mean meta ranked  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1320) |  name rank content [? cheese? ?] JOHN

MUELLER: I don't know. Well, anyway, so on the one hand, I was putting together all of the general SEO information that we have that we can give people, and tell them what to do, like our SEO starter guide. Also some of the other third party SEO starter guides that are out there. There's some, I think, really useful stuff. But there is like a ton of information out there. And if you don't know anything about SEO, it's really hard to get started. So that's something where they also came to me and it's like,  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1350) |  so how do I find someone to

do SEO for my website? And we have a video on that. We have, I think, some Help Center pages on that. So that was kind of useful to point them there. But it's still one of those situations where it's like, well, I don't really feel comfortable just recommending someone that I know, even if I know there are some really good people out there. And it was more that I was trying  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1380) |  to find ways to give them advice

on what they should be looking for when it comes to an SEO. And in the past when people ask me about this, usually I told them to find someone local that you can work together with in person, and discuss the problems and questions that you have about your website. Nowadays, you don't really do a lot of business in person anymore because of all the coronavirus stuff. But it's still something where being at least in the same time  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1410) |  zone and being able to do some

kind of phone call, video conference, makes it a lot easier to discuss. And it makes it a lot easier to figure out what kind of needs you really have and what kind of things the SEO side could be helping with. So that was really interesting to point them at that. One of the things that I ended up doing more for my own sake was to crawl their website.

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1440) |  So that's something that before I joined

Google, I wrote a sitemap generator that basically went off and crawled websites. GARY ILLYES: Of course you did. JOHN MUELLER: Which was really fun. And it was one of those things that I found extremely insightful, because then you notice how broken the web is. Kind of like how you mentioned, Gary, on the one hand, the content on the web is really broken. On the other hand, all of the URLs and crawling on the web is just so broken.  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1470) |  And it's sometimes a surprise that Google

can get through it all. But I picked up some third party website crawler tool and I played around with it, and it's really cool to see how you can just crawl your website and see what the current status is. And especially when you compare it to something like Search Console, which is based on what we index, it is really interesting to see that immediate feedback where you can just crawl your whole website in an hour and see what comes out, versus in Search Console,  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1500) |  where you wait a month and see

what comes out. So I mean, it's not to say Search Console is not useful in that regard. But it's just, well, Search takes a long time to update everything across all of its indexes. And understanding those differences, I thought was really useful. So I pointed them at a website crawler like that as well and said, if you're going to make big changes on your website, here's  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1530) |  one way to test that before waiting

to see how Google actually figures things out. So I thought that was pretty cool. GARY ILLYES: That's fun. MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah, I always find it awkward when people are asking for recommendations about SEO, and especially if they are close friends and you are like, well, I can't really tell you. And then they are like, but you work on Search! It's like yeah, that's exactly the problem. And then you point them to the documentation, and they are like, are you really just sending me to some documentation that you wrote for the noobs?  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1560) |  Like, you are a noob. Like, what?

JOHN MUELLER: [CHUCKLING] MARTIN SPLITT: And then when someone asks for an SEO recommendation, like recommend an SEO company, then it gets even more awkward, because I do know tons of good SEO companies that I could recommend. But since I am working on Search, plus we are the face of Search for SEOs  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1590) |  and marketers and webmasters and whatnot, how

do you single out one SEO company and recommend it? It's just so weird, or it would be so weird. So yeah, that's also really weird. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. It's an interesting struggle, because we're so involved with the whole community. And at the same time, we really don't want to point at any particular people and say, well, we know them really well and you should go and do business with them. I don't think that would be fair. So-- MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah. GARY ILLYES: That's true. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah.  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1620) |  Another cool thing I found, not while

looking at their website, but just on Twitter in general, is this really cool presentation from Tobias Willmann. He's also from Zurich, so woohoo Swiss people. I hope he's Swiss. I don't know, actually, for sure. GARY ILLYES: [SPEAKING GERMAN] MARTIN SPLITT: Local community, woot woot! JOHN MUELLER: But he's in Switzerland. He did this really cool presentation, and kind of some research on GIF SEO. Have you ever heard of that? MARTIN SPLITT: I heard "Jif."  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1650) |  Isn't that like a peanut butter brand

or something in the US? JOHN MUELLER: No, no, GIF. GARY ILLYES: No, that's the image format. JOHN MUELLER: Like, like-- GARY ILLYES: GIF. JOHN MUELLER: Animated images, yeah, GIF. MARTIN SPLITT: Oh, you mean "Gif." JOHN MUELLER: GIFs, yeah. GARY ILLYES: No, "Jif." JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. MARTIN SPLITT: I know that the inventor got it wrong how his own invention is called, but yeah, it's definitely "Gif." JOHN MUELLER: OK. GARY ILLYES: Am I called Gary or Jerry? MARTIN SPLITT: You're called Gary. JOHN MUELLER: Jerry! GARY ILLYES: I think I'm Jerry. JOHN MUELLER: Oh, so cool. MARTIN SPLITT: Sometimes you're George. GARY ILLYES: I made a terrible mistake. JOHN MUELLER: [CHUCKLES] Now we know you're Jerry.  

#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1680) |  Cool. Well, I mean, people never have

problems pronouncing your name anyway, so. GARY ILLYES: [SIGHS] Story of my life. [LAUGHTER] JOHN MUELLER: Anyway. So one of the cool things in that presentation was kind of a side note that actually, some of these GIF search engines are really popular. And apparently one of them is actually the second most popular search engine. GARY ILLYES: What? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. Like, I never realized-- GARY ILLYES: Let me repeat that. What?  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1710) |  JOHN MUELLER: What? I mean, I don't

know if it's really like the second most popular. Maybe Google is second most popular. I don't know. Joogle. GARY ILLYES: Google? MARTIN SPLITT: Joogle. GARY ILLYES: Joogle. No, wait. MARTIN SPLITT: So what's up, Jerry? JOHN MUELLER: All right. Well, anyway, it's really obvious once you think about where these search engines go, namely on your phone, on your keyboard, when you're looking for an animated image, it goes to one of these GIF search engines, right? MARTIN SPLITT: Yeah. JOHN MUELLER: It's like you're looking for a meme, you're looking for something funny to add to a chat  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1740) |  or to Twitter or whatever, you go

there and you search for something specific, kind of like a Martin reaction GIF or something-- MARTIN SPLITT: [LAUGHS] JOHN MUELLER: --and you include that in your message. And it's like, obviously people are just going off and searching for funny images, and not always going to Google to search for something useful or informative. MARTIN SPLITT: And John, to be fair, we both are meme material when it comes to that.  

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1770) |  I know that I have a few

GIFs of myself that I use as reactions sometimes, and people have seen them in slides and enjoyed them. And I think we need more of these. Izzi Smith has a bunch of SEO memes and SEO funny images, and I think also GIFs. We should probably produce more of that. I'm pretty sure in our video material there's so much that you can use for reaction GIFs or "Jifs." GARY ILLYES: It's "Jifs." MARTIN SPLITT: We should support that. We should do more of that. JOHN MUELLER: We should do more reaction GIFs, yeah. That's pretty cool. Or maybe we can do stickers, like Googlebot stickers,  

#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1800) |  like the virtual kind. MARTIN SPLITT: Oh,

that's good stuff. But how do you actually make these stickers? JOHN MUELLER: It's in his presentation. I'll send you a link. It's pretty cool. MARTIN SPLITT: OK, I need to check that out. JOHN MUELLER: Also, the way to do SEO for these is hashtags. Basically keywords. MARTIN SPLITT: Wow GARY ILLYES: So meta keywords would work there? JOHN MUELLER: Meta keywords is how you rank your GIFs. MARTIN SPLITT: [LAUGHS] That's-- OK. That's interesting. GARY ILLYES: That worked out really nice for early search engines.  

#### [0:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1830) |  Web search engines. JOHN MUELLER: Well, I

think-- I mean, I don't know, maybe people search differently when they're looking for GIFs. But who knows, maybe all of that will change, and it's more a generational question, and at some point people will be like, what do you mean people searched for text? GARY ILLYES: Ah, wait, but you know what a difference is? There is no commercial intent. MARTIN SPLITT: It's true. JOHN MUELLER: Not yet. MARTIN SPLITT: And how would spam look like? I mean, if there's like advertisement in the GIF or "Jif" results, then  

#### [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1860) |  you would just, like, not click on

it? That's it? JOHN MUELLER: Well, I don't know. I'm sure there are pictures of spam that you can include in GIFs. [LAUGHTER] GARY ILLYES: --spam. MARTIN SPLITT: Hashtag spam. GARY ILLYES: I love spam. Spam, spam, spam. MARTIN AND GARY: (SINGING) Spam, spam, spam, and eggs. JOHN MUELLER: OK, wait. Wait, wait. MARTIN AND GARY: Spam, spam. JOHN MUELLER: Guys, guys. I think we should just cut it off here. This is getting out of hand. GARY ILLYES: Spam. [LAUGHTER] MARTIN SPLITT: Spam, beans, and eggs. JOHN MUELLER: Wait, stop. MARTIN AND GARY: (SINGING) Spam, spam, spam, spam. JOHN MUELLER: No.  

#### [0:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65rE4mvzCX0&t=1890) |  GARY ILLYES: Eggs-- MARTIN SPLITT: --and spam.
