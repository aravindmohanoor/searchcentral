#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=0) |  JOHN MUELLER: All right. Welcome, everyone, to

today's Google Search Central office hours hangout. My name is John Mueller. I'm a Search Advocate at Google. And part of what I do is these office hours, where people can join in and ask questions around their website and web search, and we can try to find some answers. And wow, lots of people joining today. Lots of questions submitted. This is good. Cool. A bunch of things were already submitted, but if any of you  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=30) |  want to get started with the first

question, you're welcome to jump on in. AUDIENCE: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. AUDIENCE: I have, actually, two questions. The first one is about changing website. So one of our clients, they changed their website. They moved the website from Wordpress to do Drupal. Fortunately, we are keeping the same URL, like WordPress, so the URL structure will not be changed. The only thing they are going to change the design of the site  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=60) |  and content. They are going to add

more content. Now, the question is, the ranking they have for those URL, the format, if they make this content change and design change, will that affect the ranking? JOHN MUELLER: It can, yes. I mean, any time you change your website, then that's something that should be reflected in your rankings, right? So if you add text to your pages, if you remove text,  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=90) |  if you change the internal linking, if

you change the layout so that you have different things as headings and titles, then that's something that should be reflected in search. So keeping the URLs the same, I think, makes it a lot easier because we just can keep a lot of the signals already, but we still need to look at the content, like what is on these pages, how they're linked between each other. And it's not the case that there will always  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=120) |  be a negative change. A lot of

people do these kind of migrations because they want to improve things. Because it's like, well, I noticed my internal linking is bad with my old CMS, and I moved to a CMS that does internal linking a lot better. So that helps me to get my site crawled better, for example. AUDIENCE: And the next question is about backlink. So how does Google measure the weight of a backlink?  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=150) |  Some people get a business listing. Some

people gets backlink from the content. Some people give backlink from the regional site, like dotcom.au. Some people get backlink from dotcom site. Does Google differentiate that, OK, this is their Australian site. They're getting back link from dotcom.au. We are giving more importance because they are getting dotcom.au. Or is it same getting backlink from dotcom and dotcom.au? And what about the other type of backlink business listing or getting backlink from content?  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=180) |  JOHN MUELLER: That gets really complicated. So

what we wouldn't differentiate is just because there are different top-level domains. So an AU site and a dotcom or a UK site or whatever, it's not that we would say they have different weights or individual types of links, but we do try to differentiate by the type of link that it is and to figure out what is its importance with regards  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=210) |  to the context that it provides. Is

it something that tells us a lot about the page that it's linking to? Or is it something that is more like, oh, by the way, we're also here kind of thing? Which is more like, well, OK, we saw it, and that's OK. AUDIENCE: Thank you, John. AUDIENCE: Hey, John. Good morning. JOHN MUELLER: Morning. AUDIENCE: I have a question about archiving. So we have a site with a large number of press release pages.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=240) |  These are quite old from maybe from

2015 and maybe even older. And the thing is they have accumulated a large amount of backlinks, but they don't get any traffic. But they're quite high [INAUDIBLE] the main pointing to them. But now, we want to clean them up because they are taking up the real estate or at least it becomes a bit too big there. Now the thing is, so I was thinking of, OK, we can move it to an archive, but I still would like to benefit  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=270) |  from the SEO power these pages have

built up over time. So is there a way to do this cleverly so, basically-- so moving them indeed to an archive, for example, subdirectory-- but then still, let's say, benefit from the SEO power? JOHN MUELLER: You can just redirect them to a different part of your site. If you have an archive section for this kind of older content, which is very common, then kind of moving the content there  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=300) |  and redirecting the URLs there, that essentially

tells us to forward the links there. AUDIENCE: But we were also thinking because a lot of them-- so they need to be there still for, let's say, legal purposes, for example. But I still would like to say, OK, you know what? The crawler doesn't need to access these folders for me all the time. So I was thinking about disallowing that folder. But we'll disallow a subdirectory. Will this also mean that the built-up SEO power will be ignored from that point onwards?  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=330) |  Because in a sense, I was thinking

like this, what you say to the scroller, hey, you don't have to crawl this folder anymore. But I don't think we say ignore the built-up SEO power. Right? Or do I see this wrong? JOHN MUELLER: So probably, we would already automatically crawl less if we recognize that they're less relevant for your site. Not the case that you need to block it completely.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=360) |  If you were to block it completely

with robots.txt, we would not know what was on those pages. So essentially, when there are lots of external links pointing to a page that is blocked by robots.txt, sometimes we can still show that page in the search results, but we'll show it with a title based on the links and a text says, oh, we don't know what is actually here. And if that page that is being linked to is something that is just referring  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=390) |  to more content within your website, we

wouldn't know. So we can't kind of indirectly forward those links to your primary content. So that's something where if you see that these pages are important enough that people are linking to them, then I would try to avoid blocking them by robots.txt. The other thing to keep in mind, also, is that these kind of press release pages, things  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=420) |  that collect over time, usually the type

of links that they attracts are a very time-limited kind of thing, whereas a news site will link to it once. And then it's like when you look at the number of links, it might look like, oh, there are lots of links here, but these are really old news articles which are in the archives of those news sites, essentially. It's also kind of a sign, well, they have links,  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=450) |  but those links are not extremely useful

because it's so irrelevant in the meantime. AUDIENCE: Thanks so much. I appreciate your time. Thanks. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. AUDIENCE: Hey, hi, John. I wanted to know something very basic about copied content. As you all know, the copied content is against Google guidelines. And it's also not a good practice in general. So I just wanted to know how Google determines if a particular piece of content is copied or not,  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=480) |  and who is the actual original source

of the content? JOHN MUELLER: How to determine if it's copied? I think it's kind of tricky, in some aspect. And in some aspect, it's really easy because if you take a piece of text and you search for it, then if exactly the same text is on the web or on other pages, then that's a pretty clear sign that it is copied. [INTERPOSING VOICES]  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=510) |  JOHN MUELLER: So for example, if you

have copied content that is more along the lines of boilerplate text, like you have, I don't know, a legal disclaimer on the bottom of your site, which is something that you have across all of your pages of your site, then technically  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=540) |  that's copied content. But practically for us

that's not really an issue because these are things that people are generally not searching for. It's not that they're searching for the legal disclaimer and they want to find your site. It's more they're looking for your primary content. And in that regard, it's something where we try to kind of weigh the copied content appropriately but also still look at the rest of your site.  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=570) |  So I don't know, actually, if that

helps with regards to your question. So that's kind of like the thing, is it's easy to recognize that there is copied content on these pages, but it's hard to figure out what we should do about that copied content. [INAUDIBLE] the author or the owner of that content, I don't think we go and make any judgment in that regard  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=600) |  because that's really tricky. We can't determine

who is the owner. And sometimes, the person who wrote it first is not the one, for example, that is the most relevant. So we see this a lot of times, for example, with our own blog posts where we will write a blog post and we'll put the information we want to share on our blog post, and someone will copy that content and they will add a lot of extra information around it.  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=630) |  It's like, here's what Google really wants

to tell you, and it's like reading between the lines and the secret to Google's algorithms. And when someone is searching, maybe they want to find original source. Maybe they want to find this more elaborate, I don't know, exploration of the content itself. So just because something is original doesn't mean that it's the one that is the most relevant when someone is looking for that information.  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=660) |  AUDIENCE: All right. All right. Thank you

for the long explanation. Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Great. All right, anything else before we jump into the questions? AUDIENCE: I submitted my question, but I can jump in now if that's fine. JOHN MUELLER: OK. AUDIENCE: So if you recall, I'm checking in again about our domain migration. We migrated our domain at the beginning of August. Had almost total traffic loss after connecting  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=690) |  in a few of these sessions. It

was indicated that Google engineering was able to make a partial fix for us. That was towards the end of September. And then we did start to see slow but some recovery. We were eking our way to almost 50% after about four months and right before the Broadcore update. And now, we dropped to basically back where we were post domain migration. So my question is if you think it's possible that the partial fix that we were  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=720) |  able to get via the engineering team

possibly got reverted? Or just otherwise how we should try to make sense of what happened with the Broadcore update. We're, of course, trying to look through that lens just neutrally and try to think about what we can do to improve the site. But with where we were before the domain migration loss and where we are now, it's a little hard to not think that we're still just dealing with domain migration issues, and if that seems likely to you, and any advice from here?  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=750) |  JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. I think

it's kind of awkward that these kind of issues pop up with domain migrations. Sorry that you're struggling with this. I think with the issue that you're seeing now, I don't think that would be related to kind of the fix in the domain migration being reverted or kind of being blocked.  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=780) |  My assumption there is that it's more

that the general core update is also affecting your site. And like this combination of those remaining lingering issues plus the core update is essentially what you're seeing there. But I will definitely take a look with the team to see if there's something more specific that's going on there that we need to watch out for. So yeah, I don't know.  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=810) |  One of the things that we ended

up doing specifically after running through your issue is trying to figure out how many other sites might be affected by these kind of site migration issues. And it seems like it's extremely rare, which doesn't really help you that much. Like I don't know. It's like a special case kind of thing. But at least that's a little bit calming on my side.  

#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=840) |  But it's something where I still think

we should be able to do a better job handling these kind of migrations and not run into issues where people have to contact us, essentially personally with regards to kind of-- I don't know-- getting things back to normal again. But so if I remember correctly, your site is about kind of university reviews? AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's mostly focused on online education.  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=870) |  JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I could imagine that

the core update is something that you might want to look into there. AUDIENCE: We are. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, and I know there are a bunch of other SEOs that have kind of dug into all of those details of what you need to watch out for with expertise, authority trust, those kind of topics. So I would definitely look into that.  

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=900) |  But usually when it comes to core

updates, it's something where it's not just one small thing that you can fix and it gets better. It's more of a long-term approach that you have to kind of look at there. AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, we're doing that internally. And we've been working with Marie Haynes and Glenn Gabe and some other SEOs. Just it's hard to not feel like it's our domain migration that is still having an extremely large impact on us.  

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=930) |  And I'm honestly not sure what else

to do except to check in here when I can. JOHN MUELLER: No, I mean, it's perfectly fine to keep pushing for this, because it's-- I mean, I try to watch what is happening with those discussions internally, but it's also good to see kind of from the external side like, oh, it's still a problem that we still need to [INAUDIBLE].. AUDIENCE: Still a problem. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, OK. AUDIENCE: OK, thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I'll definitely double check, though, specifically  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=960) |  around the core update, if there's something

that might be kind of uniquely happening with your site that maybe we need to fix in that regard. AUDIENCE: OK, thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. OK, let me run through some of the submitted questions. And if you have any questions along the way, feel free to jump on in as well. In Search Console we noticed our pages are marked as crawled, currently not indexed. Looking into the detail, we see that Google has found our user-declared canonical,  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=990) |  but then picked a completely different unrelated

page for its Google-selected canonical. Any idea why this might be? So usually this kind of situation is something where I'd need to look at the details. So it's a bit tricky without having any URLs there. One thing you could, perhaps, do is post in the Help Forum. And try to provide some details, some examples there so that the experts there can take a look, and maybe give you some tips or escalate that  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1020) |  to the search team if needed. One

of the places where I have seen this happen is when a website is set up in a way that it's hard for us to tell which parts of a URL are actually relevant. So that could be, for example, if you have a number of different websites that all have the same back end system, and the same URLs lead to the same content across the different domains.  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1050) |  Then it could be that our systems

say, well, actually the domain name isn't so relevant here. We will pick any one of these domains as the canonical for this kind of URL pattern. It could also be that you have a URL structure that maybe something in the path or in the URL parameters is deemed as being irrelevant to our systems. In that sense, it's not irrelevant in that the content is bad kind of thing.  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1080) |  But it's irrelevant in that when we

look at a number of different parameters, we see always the same content. And therefore, our systems kind of learn over time that actually this URL pattern is something that doesn't lead to unique content, but rather we can pick one of the URLs that is kind of in this group of URL patterns, and pick that as a canonical. And that happens regardless of what the actual content is on individual pages once we've learned that pattern.  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lTIR8hM5pbw/hq1.jpg)



#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1110) |  So that makes it a little bit

easier for us to kind of deal with canonicalization without having to crawl the whole site and get stuck in all of these URL patterns that are essentially leading to the same content. And in a case like that, it could happen that you have a URL structure that, for a large part, leads to similar content where we get confused. But there are individual pieces in there which do lead to unique content.  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1140) |  And then it could happen like this,

that our systems say, well, all of this is irrelevant. We will pick one here. And we don't realize that actually, well, this one here is kind of an exception. So if you think that might be the case in your situation, one thing you can do is try to figure out, do you perhaps have this kind of pattern of URLs that all lead to the same content? You could do something like look at your server logs to see which URLs are being crawled, and based on those,  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1170) |  try those URLs out in your browser,

and see, is this something that is all leading to the same content? Is Google somehow getting stuck with URL parameters or with crawling of the website? And based on that, you can work to kind of exclude the discovery of these irrelevant URLs, and focus on the ones that you really do want to have indexed. I notice that often when we publish a new article  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1200) |  on our site, the article's ranking starts

to improve as time goes by. For example, in this case, it took five months from the date of publication of the article to reach a stable ranking. This happened despite the fact that the article has not changed in five months. It's the same from the beginning. So I would expect the article ranking to be the same right away. Obviously this is not the case. So what happens on Google's side in the time between publication of a new page and its stabilization in ranking?  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1230) |  I didn't take a look at that

specific example. But it's very common that it takes some time for our signals to kind of settle down and to better understand what is on a specific page. And this is something that is very visible, for example, if you have a new website. Then you might publish that new website. And in the beginning Google might go, oh, it's a new website. We found it. If someone is explicitly looking for it, we'll probably show it.  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1260) |  But over time, over a couple of

months we will try to understand, well, what is the relevance of this new website? In which regards is it important for the web? And then we'll show it maybe for more and more queries over time. And that's not something where our systems-- I don't know. It's essentially just something that takes time for us to collect all of the signals that are associated with these pages. And it's not something that can happen from one day  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1290) |  to the next. And it can also

happen for individual pages as well. So it's not just specific to new websites like that. For some queries I see Google ranking websites which have a high amount of ad content, which is creating a poor search experience. How is Google dealing with those sites? It's hard to say without having examples. But there are various things that we  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1320) |  do take into account with regards to

the user experience side of things. So on the one hand, we did I think a couple years ago an update where the above the fold content is something that we weight a little bit more. So that's something where if there's a lot of ad content above the fold, then perhaps it might be affected by that. There are other updates that have  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1350) |  happened in the past with regards to

speed. There is the Core Web Vitals, which is going to be launched I think in May with regards to ranking in search results, which also helps there. But the other thing also to keep in mind is we use a lot of different factors to determine ranking in the search results to try to understand what is relevant for users in individual tines. And it can very well happen that a page is extremely relevant  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1380) |  in some regards but still has a

really bad user experience. And we will still show it in the search results. And sometimes we show it highly in the search results. So just because a page has a bad user experience, and if we were to take that bad user experience into account it doesn't mean we would never show that page. This is something that is really common, for example, if you search for a website's name, then you would expect to find that website.  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1410) |  Even if that website is kind of

like doing weird things, has a really bad user experience, you would still expect to find that website. And there is a broad range of different kinds of queries and kinds of understanding of relevance that flow into things like that. So with that said, it's always possible to find these kind of pages in the search results. It's extremely rare for us to manually go in and say  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1440) |  we will completely remove this website from

search so it never shows up for any queries. We usually reserve that specifically for cases where the whole website is essentially irrelevant, where the whole website is just scraping content from the rest of the web and there's nothing unique of value at all on the website. Then that's something where the web spam team might go in and say, this is a pure spam website.  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1470) |  There is nothing of value here. Then

we'll remove that from search. But for everything else, it's kind of like, we can still show it. And in some cases, the other factors play a larger role. I think this is also really important, because a lot of people don't know everything that they should be doing on the website. They don't know all of the details of what is important or what they should not do. They don't know those tricks that they heard from friends. Are they kind of like really bad,  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1500) |  or are they just kind of bad?

Or do they kind of work sometimes? And they end up doing lots of weird things. And all of these websites that do things which are kind of suboptimal, where as an expert you might look at it and say, oh, they should not be doing this, this is so clearly black hat, against the webmaster guidelines, they might not know. And they might be a legitimate small business, and they just have their website like that.  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1530) |  And in cases like that, I think

we should definitely still continue to show that website. It's not that it's completely irrelevant for users. Maybe they're just doing things in ways that they don't know any better. Let's see. Updating the design of a website, plus a few URL changes. Content remains largely the same, but getting a few updates where necessary. There is about 2,000 URLs. Given the core update is still rolling out,  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1560) |  should I hang on for a week

or push the go live button now? I would just move forward. So the core updates that we do tend to be focused more on broader changes in the search results. And it's not something where if you make a change right at the same time, then it suddenly clashes and breaks anything. So in that regard, I would not hold off and kind of like artificially hold myself back.  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1590) |  If you're making improvements on your website,

and usually if you change things like this across a site, then I would classify that as improvements. And I would just move forward and do those improvements so that they're live as early as possible. AUDIENCE: Thanks, John. JOHN MUELLER: Cool. Let's see. We changed our website's domain name. The old one's search ranking was decreased to zero, however,  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1620) |  the new one's search ranking is much

lower than the old site's ranking. This reminds me of a different question. However-- let's see-- some expert said it takes up to six months to achieve original rankings. How can we speed up the SEO results? Some backlinks link to the old site. Do we need to change the links to the new site? Now, for the most part, I think-- well, one of the things I would strongly recommend is just making sure that you're following the guidelines  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1650) |  that we have, specifically for site moves,

the details as much as possible. Especially if this site move is still fairly fresh, then making sure that you have things like all of the redirects set up so that all of the old content is really moving to the new site. That's something I would do. I would double check all the settings in Search Console so that you have all of that lined up. But in our guidelines, we also mention the links to the site. And we do mention that it does make sense  

#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1680) |  to get those updated as well. In

particular, with the links to the site, we use that for canonicalization. So if we're not sure if we should show the old one or the new one, then if we see that there are lots of links to one of these versions, then that helps us to try to make that decision. It sounds like canonicalization is less an issue there if you are seeing that there's already no traffic going to the old domain. But still, I think updating some of those links where  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1710) |  you can makes sense. Where you're going

to run into the same kind of issue on our side as well, when we did the migration to Google Search Central from Webmaster Central, because it's like I think the Twitter pages or the YouTube main account pages, they don't redirect for whatever reasons. So we're also discussing internally if we should ask people to help update the links, which  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1740) |  is kind of weird. But I guess

everyone has to do that. In general, it can take a while for things to settle down after a site migration. But it should, for the most part, be fairly straightforward. The one situation where I have seen issues with regards to site migrations-- well, I guess the more common one where I've seen  

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1770) |  issues is when the new domain name,

the one that you're moving to, has a really weird history associated with it, then that's something where it can get tricky for us to understand, what does this migration mean? So in particular, if the old domain used to be hosting a lot of web spam content, or the new domain is hosting a lot of-- or was hosting a lot of web spam content, and you move there,  

#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1800) |  then we have all of these kind

of spammy signals that are associated with the domain name that you move to, plus the new signals from your old content. And that makes it sometimes hard for us to figure out, what does this mean? So that's something that you might want to look into. In general, if you're moving to a domain, if you're starting a website on a new domain, looking at the domain's history is something I'd still recommend doing.  

#### [0:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1830) |  There are lots of things that you

can clean up with regards to taking on a used domain name. But some things are a lot more time intensive than others. So in particular, if a website was deeply involved in web spam and has a lot of really problematic links from across the web, then that's something that you might want to clean up ahead of time, which takes a lot of time.  

#### [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1860) |  Another situation where you might want to

kind of keep in mind that it will take a bit of time is if the domain that you're moving to used to host a lot of adult content, then we might have that domain in our safe search list, essentially. And as we see that your content is now hosted there, then that will update automatically. But it can take a bit of time for us to kind of switch from, oh, we should be filtering this domain using safe search  

#### [0:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1890) |  to this is actually a-- I don't

know-- a completely normal domain with traditional content, let's call it. So those are kind of the situations that I would watch out for. [INAUDIBLE] a subdomain, like m.domain, to www.domain.com. The site is now responsive, and the mobile version is no longer needed. Should I use a change of address tool in Search Console?  

#### [0:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1920) |  You can use it. You don't need

to use it. So the change of address tool in particular helps us when you're moving to a new domain name, because then we can forward those more domain-level signals a little bit easier than if we had to do that on a per URL basis. But if you're moving just between subdomains within the same domain, then that's not something you'd need to do that. It also doesn't cause any problems. So if you've done that in the past, and you're like,  

#### [0:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1950) |  oh, no, I should revert it, don't

worry about that. We're exploring web stories and using tappable, which we have embedded in our site. When I test the URL in the Inspect URL tool, it doesn't show up. What can we do about it? I don't know what tappable is. So it's hard for me to say what exactly to do there.  

#### [0:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=1980) |  Web stories are based on AMP pages.

So for web stories you would use the AMP testing tool to see that they work well, that the structured data there is recognized properly. So that might be something to check out. With regards to whether or not these URLs are indexed, web stories, by design, are normal AMP pages, like I said. So they can get indexed individually. And they're set up in a way that they're canonical AMP.  

#### [0:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2010) |  That means it's not like AMP pages

that are associated with the rest of your website where you have the canonical as the traditional HTML page and the AMP HTML alternate version. For web stories you only have the AMP version. And essentially, that can get indexed like any other normal content. We currently don't show web stories in all places, all countries I think.  

#### [0:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2040) |  But we do show AMP content pretty

much I think in all countries. So if you have a web story, what will happen is it might be shown in these web story-specific services if you're in one of those countries. But if you're not in one of those countries, it'll be shown in the normal web search results. So it'll be shown just like any other web page might be. Since it's also a normal web page, like any other,  

#### [0:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2070) |  you need to think about the usual

SEO aspects there too. So things like titles, and headings, and text on the page, all the attributes for images, all of the usual things, they all apply to web stories. It's a bit trickier with web stories, because traditionally you want to make it kind of visually impressive, which means you don't have this big blocks of text on these web stories, but you still need textual content so that we can rank those pages properly.  

#### [0:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2100) |  Question about AMP? My website, 97% traffic

is from desktop users. Should I need to be worried about AMP? Because in the Search Console I can see some AMP errors on my website. Is it worth spending time and effort on to fix those issues since the majority of the traffic is from desktop?  

#### [0:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2130) |  Will it impact ranking in the long

term? So AMP pages are responsive. So essentially, you can use them on desktop too. It's not something that is purely mobile. There are lots of sites that use AMP as their primary framework for making content, and that's perfectly fine. So that's something where just because you have a lot of desktop users doesn't  

#### [0:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2160) |  mean you should not use AMP. For

example, I think the AMP.dev site is completely written in AMP. And if you look at it in a desktop browser, it looks like a normal website. With regards to AMP errors, what happens with AMP pages when we recognize their errors on these pages is we understand that they're not valid AMP pages. And that means that those pages would not be kept in the AMP cache and would not  

#### [0:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2190) |  be treated as AMP alternates if you

have this setup with the traditional HTML and the AMP alternate pages. If you have errors in the AMP version, then we would not show those AMP alternate URLs in the search results. So it's not that there would be a ranking effect from that, but more that you're not getting the full value out of your AMP pages because we can't put them in the cache. We can't serve them immediately when people click on them. It's more of a usability kind of thing.

#### [0:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2220) |  It's like you're already doing a big

part to make those AMP pages work, but they're not completely valid. So we can't actually use them as AMP pages. By mistake I created a lot of tags and sometimes of the same name with the main category. It ends up that the tag pages score better in the search results than my categories. Will the use of rel canonical help so that I can send the juice back to the main category?  

#### [0:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2250) |  How long will it take until this

change is implemented? So sometimes it can happen that you have a lot of different pages on a site, and the wrong ones end up ranking. And cleaning up the site's structure makes it a lot easier for us to pick out which pages you really want to have shown in the search results. So cleaning up the URL structure means, on the one hand, removing or reducing the amount of internal links  

#### [0:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2280) |  to those kinds of pages, and, on

the other hand, using technical elements like the rel canonical or setting up redirects to point at the pages that you do want to have shown in the search results. So in that regard, if you're seeing that you have a bunch of similar pages and the wrong ones are ranking, then cleaning that up definitely helps. It can improve the ranking of those pages, because if we can concentrate all the value in fewer pages,  

#### [0:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2310) |  then we can make those pages a

little bit stronger in search. They can be a little bit more relevant. With regards to how long that takes, it's really hard to say. In particular, we have to crawl these pages, and on a per URL basis, we have to understand, oh, this is the same content. You have a rel canonical here. We should switch indexing to the other page. And on a per URL basis, that takes a little bit of time. The crawling itself also takes a little bit of time.  

#### [0:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2340) |  And crawling is not something where there

is a fixed time frame involved. It can be that we recrawl some pages within, I don't know, a couple days, other pages within a couple of weeks. So that's something where it's really hard to say how long it'll take. Accessibility question. We're going to make invisible headings for some sections of our pages, for example, like main navigation, kind of highlighting.  

#### [0:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2370) |  How will Google understand that this is

not cloaking? So we probably would not understand that this is not cloaking. But this kind of hidden text is something that is super common on the web, and we essentially just deal with that. So that's less of an issue for us. Even if we were to recognize that this is hidden text on a page, it's not that we would say, oh, this is a spammy page because it has hidden text on it.  

#### [0:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2400) |  But at most, we might say, oh,

well, maybe this piece of text here is not super relevant for this page because users never see it. So in your situation, if you have main navigation as kind of a heading for people who are using voice browsers essentially, then people are probably not going to search for main navigation on Google to try to find your site. They're going to look for your actual content, which is something that would be visible there.  

#### [0:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2430) |  So in that regard, even if Google

were to recognize that this is something that is less relevant for your site, it wouldn't negatively affect the rest of your site. We're facing consistent impression spikes on Google Webmaster Tools. Oh, no. That's a really old tool. You should switch to Search Console. Usually we average between 2,000 and 3,000 per day. On Fridays it goes up to 10,000 on certain keywords.  

#### [0:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2460) |  Any suggestion on what could be causing

the impression spikes? It's really hard to say. On the one hand, this could be something that users are just searching more on some days. And this is really common, depending on the type of website that you have, that you see kind of like a weekly cycle through the number of impressions that are taking place for your site, where you have either  

#### [0:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2490) |  on the weekends a lot of impressions,

or during the week a lot of impressions, or during the daytime, or during the evening. These kind of cycles are really common. So perhaps you're seeing something there. What I also sometimes see is that some of the rank checking tools leave behind traces in Search Console. And you also see side effects like this. For the most part, these are things that we do filter out  

#### [0:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2520) |  in the rest of our pipeline, but

sometimes they just linger on in Search Console a bit like this. We're about to run an A/B test for metered paywall with different variations, so each variation and its paywall schema. We're embedding the roadblocks through a third-party tool. We can't know which versions are aimed at which users because it's on the fly. Is there an option to fit only one paywall schema  

#### [0:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2550) |  for all the different tests? Sure, so

the usual setup that people do-- well, at least the setup that I've seen is that they essentially provide this paywall markup for the version that-- or in a way that matches what users would always see. So if there is, for example, a lead-in  

#### [0:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2580) |  that you would always show all users,

and some users see more content, and some users see less content, or some users can see more pages, or some users see the paywall immediately, then you add the paywall markup in a way that matches what everyone would see, kind of like the lowest common denominator then. And that way, we can understand that. And it's not the case that we need to have the 100% exact correct paywall markup on all  

#### [0:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2610) |  of these pages. If we can recognize

that there is a paywall markup there, then that already helps us to understand that, oh, you're implementing a paywall, and it's different by user type, or by location, or whatever you use kind of as parameters. And that's totally fine for us then. How do you test the structured data for specifically the paywall structured data? Essentially you would use a rich results test, like with any other kind of structured data.  

#### [0:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2640) |  I think the tricky part with some

of these paywall implementations is that Googlebot, of course, needs to be able to see the full content so that we can understand what it is that we should be showing your site for. And with that, we should be able to see the paywall markup as well. So if you're showing the paywall markup, depending on kind of like the user there, keep in mind that probably users don't  

#### [0:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2670) |  need to see the paywall markup. It's

really important that we see it, though, especially if you're serving Googlebot the content and not showing it to users in some cases. Let's see. I cross-run many sites. About once a week I get a notification from Search Console that datavocabulary.org has been phased out. It's no longer actually an issue for any of the sites. So I'm curious how long Google will store it and process the HTML for it.  

#### [0:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2700) |  Some of the pages that pop up

had their last crawl up to three years ago, and even on the HTTP versions of the site, which have been redirected to HTTPS for even longer. I don't know. Like once a week, that sounds pretty excessive. I thought we just sent out that notification like once for all sites that were using it. So if you're watching this and can send me  

#### [0:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2730) |  some details of what you're seeing, that

would be really useful. Because, like I said, this notification is something that we should be doing just once for the site. Usually with these kind of notifications, we focus on what we last had indexed for those sites. So it's less a matter of when we last crawled those, but rather like, oh, we know that this markup used to be on your site or is on your site based on the last version  

#### [0:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2760) |  that we have indexed for your site.

And then we'll notify you about that. And like I said, this should be something that should be like a one-time thing per site, rather than a weekly notification. And it's mostly just meant to let you know that-- it's like, by the way, if you still have this here, you should probably switch it out. It shouldn't be something that's like super annoying.  

#### [0:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2790) |  But if you can send me some

details, then I'm happy to take a look to see what might be happening there. I recently tweaked the meta title and description to improve quality of the words and made it more fresh, as I wanted to update it for a while already. After I updated it for one of the search queries, I noticed my site is being indexed with just that one word, that keyword search. That makes me worry that the rank might never improve again,  

#### [0:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2820) |  as I recently saw a drop in

ranking for that particular keyword before the tweak. Can you explain why Google Search can rewrite a meta title up to an extent where it only leaves one word as a meta title? I suspect you're seeing something very specific. So it's really hard to say. But it is something where we do sometimes change the titles of pages, in particular  

#### [0:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2850) |  when we can recognize that the title

on a page is perhaps not the most relevant one to show to users based on their current query. So based on the query, we can show different titles. Based on the kind of title that you have specified on your site, we might show a different title. For example, if you have the same title across a lot of different pages, then we might assume, well, maybe this title is not so relevant for any individual page.  

#### [0:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2880) |  Or if you have something really common

and shared on your title, like you just have Home for your home page, then we wouldn't show Home as a title. We would try to figure out, well, what is this home page about, and try to show something from that as a title. And when we change the titles like that, it's not a sign that we're changing the rankings, that the site is not ranking for what it has in its titles. It's more that we're just saying, well,  

#### [0:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2910) |  the title that you have on your

pages is not something that encourages a lot of people to actually click through. So perhaps we should show something that is more relevant for your individual pages. If you're seeing this very often across pages on your website, then I would take a step back and try to look at the titles that you have specified on your site. Also, the descriptions maybe if you're seeing it with this snippet. And think about what you could be doing perhaps differently  

#### [0:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2940) |  to make it a little bit clearer,

what actually is a useful title here for users. So a really common example that I see where we do sometimes rewrite titles is if you just include a big collection of keywords, and you say, oh, I want to rank for these keywords. I will put them all in my title. When we look at that we say, well, this is like a collection of words. It's not a description of a page. So maybe we should rewrite that.  

#### [0:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=2970) |  And similarly, with descriptions and snippets, it's

kind of the same thing. If we recognize that this snippet is essentially just a bunch of variations of kind of like SEO phrases you want to rank for, then we'll try to pick something either from the snippet that you have there or from a part of the page, and we'll try to show that to users when they search. AUDIENCE: John, just a quick follow up on that. When Google starts rewriting titles,  

#### [0:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3000) |  is that kind of a good sign

that you should look at them and try to improve them, and that will actually help you become more relevant? Since Google apparently doesn't think you're relevant enough? JOHN MUELLER: I don't know if it would help you become more relevant. But I think what it would help you definitely immediate-- in kind of the short term is that more likely we will show the title  

#### [0:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3030) |  that you have on your page. And

if that title is better in the sense that it matches what users are looking for, it matches their intent, then that gives you more traffic. And then indirectly, over time, maybe those users recommend you, and your site improves in ranking overall. But it's not so much that we would say, oh, this title is now good enough to show, therefore, the website is better. AUDIENCE: No, I'm thinking in cases like, as you mentioned,  

#### [0:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3060) |  maybe the title is Home, or something

like that, and the title does play a role in how relevant that page is. And you change it to Red Widgets-- I don't know, something that is more relevant. Then shouldn't that lead to the page becoming more relevant for red widgets, since you're now actually using those words? JOHN MUELLER: Sure, sure. Yeah. I mean, but that's kind of the I would almost  

#### [0:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3090) |  say less common situation. The more common

one I see is someone where the title is red widgets, blue widgets, green widgets, all widgets. AUDIENCE: All right. JOHN MUELLER: It's like widgets, plural, singular kind of thing, like a title like that. And if you just change it to red widgets, then it helps us a little bit, but just including all variations of all the keywords there doesn't make a page relevant automatically.  

#### [0:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3120) |  AUDIENCE: OK, and just to be sure,

when you're changing the title, does that mean you're actually ignoring whatever is in the HTML code per se? I mean, you're completely ignoring the user-generated title tag when you're not-- JOHN MUELLER: No, it's really just the title that we show in the search results. So it's not that we say, oh, we will skip this. We will not use it for ranking. It's just we don't show it for this particular query. Because it also depends on what people are actually searching.  

#### [0:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3150) |  AUDIENCE: Sure, yeah. AUDIENCE: John, is it

query agnostic then? I mean, does it change on the fly? So can't page titles and meta descriptions change to improve, if you like, search result diversification? So they pick something out and change the actual page title and meta description to sort of vary the results? I don't know. JOHN MUELLER: I don't know if we would do it to vary the results.  

#### [0:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3180) |  But we do try to use it

in a way to better explain what a user would expect when they go there. So I don't think-- AUDIENCE: It wouldn't change depending on the query. It would depend on the document rather than the query. That's what I'm saying. JOHN MUELLER: It would change based on a query. So that's something that you often see, especially in a case where you have a very generic title, like Home, for example, for a page.  

#### [0:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3210) |  Then you often see, depending on how

you search, you'll see either home, or you see kind of a rewritten version, or you see a name of the company, or something like that. So it would change based on the query. But it's not the case that we would change the titles based on what is shown as titles for the other pages in the search results page. AUDIENCE: Right, OK. So it wouldn't be used as part of a collection of the top 10 or whatever, just to sort of switch things up and make  

#### [0:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3240) |  sure there's a range of different types

of results? JOHN MUELLER: No. AUDIENCE: OK. AUDIENCE: John, regarding this, I have also seen one case where one page was ranking for three keywords. For two queries, the original title it was showing, but for a third query, it was rewriting the title. So all the time, it is not like very simple and where we can go and just think like this title is not  

#### [0:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3270) |  relevant. Sometimes it is like we have

to go ahead with the same title. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's tricky. We've also discussed, internally, options like having a meta tag, saying like, I know what I'm doing. Always show my title kind of thing. But that's also really tricky. And it makes things complex in various ways. We also had a project underway at some point  

#### [0:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3300) |  where in Search Console you could specify

a title for like a handful of pages, and say like, I always want this title to be shown. And there also we just noticed that there are lots of weird edge cases where showing a title algorithmically just makes it much easier for users to recognize that this is actually a good page to match what they were looking for. AUDIENCE: Mhm.

#### [0:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3330) |  JOHN MUELLER: Maria, I think you had

a question. Or you raised your hand at least. You're muted. We can't hear you. We can't hear you, Maria. AUDIENCE: Sorry, I was muted. Sorry, again. So yeah, I did have a question.  

#### [0:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3360) |  However, when Dawn Anderson asked her question,

it kind of clarified the question I had. However, going back again to titles and description-- sorry to ask. Maybe this has been commented before. One thing we are seeing-- I work, as I said, with small businesses. And some clients, they saturate-- because someone told them or something,  

#### [0:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3390) |  they saturate their title or their description

only with commercial keywords because they said, it works for such and such a person. For example, you can see in some websites like [INAUDIBLE] Brighton, flower delivery in Brighton, wedding flowers Brighton, and all that in a description. I don't know if that is against practices.  

#### [0:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3420) |  Why does that keep happening? I mean,

people do it because they say it works. Is that against practices? I don't know. It doesn't look right. When the client comes to me and I see that, the first thing I say, this has to change. It doesn't look right aesthetically. But I don't know. I just want to hear your point of view. Why?  

#### [0:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3450) |  Yeah. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, so-- AUDIENCE: And

if I made sense. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So it's not against our webmaster guidelines. So it's not something that we would say is problematic. I think at most, it's something where you could improve things if you had kind of like a better fitting title, because we understand the relevance a little bit better. And I suspect the biggest improvement with a title,  

#### [0:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3480) |  in that regard there, is that if

you can create a title that matches what the user is actually looking for, then it's a little bit easier for them to actually click on the search result, because they think, oh, this really matches what I was looking for. Whereas if you're looking for, I don't know, flower delivery Brighton, and as a title in the search results you see flowers, green flowers, yellow flowers, blue flowers, Brighton, and all of the cities nearby, then you might look at that and say, well, is this,  

#### [0:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3510) |  I don't know, some SEO result? Or

is this actually a business that will do a good job and create some nice flowers for me? So that's something where I almost think it's more a matter of improving the click-through rate, rather than improving the ranking. And if with the same ranking you get a higher click-through rate because people recognize your site as being more relevant, then that's kind of a good thing.  

#### [0:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3540) |  AUDIENCE: Sorry, sorry. I just note because

I saw a comment saying something about funeral flowers, and yeah, I thought-- I don't know. Thank you. Yeah, it makes sense. I mean, it's not a practice I follow. It's just I wanted-- the reason I'm asking this is because normally I always send the webmaster videos to my clients. And I say, watch from minute x to z.  

#### [0:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3570) |  And this is a common practice I

see with people that come from-- that they launched their own website, and they've tried to keep it [INAUDIBLE] to their [INAUDIBLE] SEO. And one of the most common activities I've seen is saturating with keywords, titles, and descriptions. So OK. Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I mean, it's a really common tactic. Because like we say as well, we use the keywords in your titles  

#### [1:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3600) |  as part of our ranking systems. And

then people say, oh, then I need to add all keywords to my titles. And then you end up with something like that. But just because they are used for ranking doesn't mean that you need to put everything in there. And sometimes I suspect the bigger aspect is really the click-through rate from search, rather than the ranking effect. Especially for small businesses, it's like you don't have a lot of chance to be visible in search results in lots of places  

#### [1:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3630) |  because you're probably more focused on your

regional area, and having a title that is really good that matches your business, that's a lot more important than having all of the keywords in it. AUDIENCE: Does it have the opposite effect on the clients, John? JOHN MUELLER: How do you mean opposite effect? AUDIENCE: Well, you know, take the example that Maria's just provided of the florist, a big florist selling flowers in every town or city in the UK, or the US,  

#### [1:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3660) |  or wherever. And all the page titles

say florist in Brighton, florist in Southsea, florist in Hampstead Heath, blah, blah, blah. Can that sometimes, because they're kind of almost competing against each other as clusters-- can that almost have the opposite effect to them ranking well and detract away from maybe just everything, because they're all candidates all of a sudden with very, very  

#### [1:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3690) |  tiny variations? I think I see that

sometimes on big sites, where they actually cannibalize themselves. JOHN MUELLER: With different pages or with the same page? AUDIENCE: Well, just competing with themselves with different pages, with many, many different pages, with small variations, with page titles being one of the quite aggressive ones that there's not a lot of difference on, if that makes sense. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, that's definitely something  

#### [1:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3720) |  that kind of happens there. And I

mean, on the one hand, I understand the interest in having pages for individual topics, but if the variations are so small you're essentially just diluting the value of your content across those pages. And then you have a lot of pages for individual topics, but they all don't rank well, versus you have one page for a slightly more general topic,  

#### [1:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3750) |  and it's very well concentrated there. Then

it's a lot easier for us to say, well, this is a really competitive page for that topic. And we should show it more. AUDIENCE: So it's back to the old fewer pages but better. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, exactly. AUDIENCE: Are they really competing against each other, those pages, though? I mean, flowers is one of the typical examples where you genuinely do need a geographic page, because they might have a genuine network.  

#### [1:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3780) |  Whereas a lot of these pages, plumbers,

and then name every single area within 200 miles, they're not. They're just doorway pages. But florists have the longest established e-commerce network anyway of that distribution method. And I think that goes back to what you were saying, that those pages aren't competing with each other. And they're not competing for the main home page title and description.  

#### [1:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3810) |  They should be genuinely standing alone. And

florists, if I remember correctly, they have the highest click-through rate of any e-commerce business because no one searches for it unless they're buying it. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. AUDIENCE: Does it depend on genuine network availability then, I think is the point that Robb's making. JOHN MUELLER: I think it's probably one of those things where it depends, as much as nobody  

#### [1:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3840) |  wants to hear that, where you kind

of have to figure out for your specific use case, is it critical that you have them separated out like this? Do you actually have unique value that you're providing there? Or is it something that you can combine a little bit more? AUDIENCE: I've seen this happen with, for example, if you're a hotel site, people search for hotels in Zurich,  

#### [1:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3870) |  but they might search for accommodation in

Zurich, travel packages, and everything like that. So I've seen sites kind of do individual pages for each of these, just so they don't stuff the title with all of these keywords. But I think-- and what I've been using as-- I don't know how good of a practice it is to alternate some of the keywords in the title with some of the keywords in the heading. And I've noticed that Google sometimes-- if you're using hotels in the title and accommodation  

#### [1:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3900) |  in the heading, and people are searching

for accommodation, Google will sometimes just use the heading instead of the title in the search results, if that makes sense. So can that be kind of a good practice to avoid creating multiple pages for what basically is the same user intent? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I mean, the other thing to keep in mind is that as the whole machine learning side expands--  

#### [1:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3930) |  and it has expanded for a long

time now-- it's something where we understand a lot better what these words actually mean. So especially synonyms, like you mentioned accommodations and hotels, we kind of know that these are the same things. And you don't need to mention those different words on the same page, because we understand it's the same thing. And I imagine for a lot of the city names, it's very similar, where we understand, well, these cities are right next to each other. So if someone is searching for one city,  

#### [1:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3960) |  we could show content from the other

one. Whether or not the user would click through and say, well, actually I really need a florist in my city, or maybe this city is across the border, and it's right next to me, but I can't easily get there for whatever reasons-- so it's kind of tricky there. But at least for the synonyms side of things, I think we are a lot better there.  

#### [1:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=3990) |  AUDIENCE: Yeah. AUDIENCE: Hi, John. I have

a question. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. AUDIENCE: With adult websites, it's very unclear which sort of schema is basically allowed there, because in some articles you mentioned that this schema is definitely not allowed for adult websites, but the majority of it is just not mentioned. So how can an adult website do this? Should they just implement everything and hope for the best? Or how can we actually know which one is important and which one not? For example, the live one.  

#### [1:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4020) |  Live is useful on blogs nowadays, on

some podcasts, but adult websites cannot use live. But it's not written there that it's not supported. So how can we know? JOHN MUELLER: I think in our rich results guidelines we say none of them are useful for adult websites. But I haven't checked recently. I don't know if anything has changed there. But at least as far as I know, all of the types of rich results that I'm aware of  

#### [1:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4050) |  are explicitly not meant for adult content

websites. AUDIENCE: OK. JOHN MUELLER: And I imagine-- so I don't think there is any kind of manual action or web spam action that takes place in something like that. But it's more that our systems recognize, oh, this is an adult website, and it wants to show these rich results types, but since it's an adult website, we just won't show them.  

#### [1:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4080) |  So it's not like it'll be demoted

or anything. AUDIENCE: Then I have a second question. Let's say that a company has some adult business and all these schema are not supported. They launch a second business which features, let's just say, no nudity, but schemas are also not picked up there because Google still thinks that's an adult website. So what makes the website adult is my question? JOHN MUELLER: What makes a website adult? I don't know. So it's--  

#### [1:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4110) |  AUDIENCE: It's one of those things, if

you have to ask, you probably already know the answer. AUDIENCE: No, I mean, let's say a website such as Twitch. I mean, Twitch has all of these things supported. Let's say that we make a website like Twitch. It's still not going to get picked up, and I wonder why. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, so the thing is, I think with a lot of the safe search filters is we try to apply them to kind of a broader URL  

#### [1:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4140) |  pattern on a website. So if we

see that the whole domain is adult content for the most part and you have some small part that is not adult, then probably we would filter the whole domain, because just our system-- AUDIENCE: All right [INAUDIBLE] pretty much. JOHN MUELLER: OK. Yeah. I mean, our systems are just kind of like we want to stay on the safe side there. If you have individual subdomains where some of them are adult and some of them are not, that makes it a little bit easier. If you have separate domains, then that obviously  

#### [1:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4170) |  makes it a lot easier for us

to understand that these are completely separate websites that should be treated differently. So it's something we also see, I think, sometimes with-- AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] by safe search, then it's adult pretty much. JOHN MUELLER: Sorry? AUDIENCE: If it's filtered by safe search, then it's adult pretty much? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't think we make any clear distinction between filtered by safe search and adult, and porn,  

#### [1:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4200) |  or whatever the different categories are there.

It's mostly like we recognize it's filtered by safe search, and then probably we wouldn't show any rich results there. It also happens the other way around, where some sites might have, I don't know, classified sections, which are for adults. And then if that section is embedded within the main website in a way that is hard to separate out, then we might say, well, we don't know how much of this site should  

#### [1:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4230) |  be filtered by safe search. Maybe we'll

filter too much. Maybe we won't filter enough. On the other hand, if you move that to a subdomain, then it's a lot easier to say, oh, this subdomain should be treated like this. The other subdomain should be treated differently. AUDIENCE: OK, understood. Clear. AUDIENCE: Does Webmaster Tools tell you if your site is held under safe search? [INTERPOSING VOICES] JOHN MUELLER: No.  

#### [1:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4260) |  Yeah, I think it's one of those

things like probably you know if your site is really adult content. But if it's kind of like a tricky thing, then I've also seen that happen that they go to the forum. It's like, my site is not showing up in search, and then someone will say, oh, well, if you turn off the same search filter, then it is showing in search. And then they try to figure out how did safe search get confused, or why is safe search so  

#### [1:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4290) |  picky in this particular situation? Because it's

one of those things where different cultures have different thresholds almost of what they would consider to be problematic or adult content. And I don't know. In our algorithms we have to make some call somewhere. AUDIENCE: True, OK. AUDIENCE: I don't know whether you saw that there was a case-- well, it was not really a case study. Fabio from Transferwise did a little bit of an investigation  

#### [1:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4320) |  into why something just suddenly just tanked.

And he found adding expletives seemed to have a bad impact. Is that the case, John? Because sometimes it's quite difficult to control communities, et cetera. And he found, I don't know whether it was just correlation versus causation, but when lots and lots of swear words got added to some content, it seemed  

#### [1:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4350) |  to have a very adverse impact on

the rankings. Is that something that might happen? Or is that just correlation versus causation? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I don't think that's something that would be by design. So maybe it's more of a side effect kind of thing. AUDIENCE: Wouldn't that then effect any site with a forum or comment section? I mean, literally every comment section in the world would-- AUDIENCE: I know, exactly.  

#### [1:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4380) |  JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. AUDIENCE: Yeah, he just

seemed to think that that was something that had impacted. Don't know. JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. I didn't see that. Sounds interesting, though. Yeah, but I don't think that would be by design. Just adding some curse words to a page shouldn't make that page less relevant suddenly. AUDIENCE: OK, yeah. Thank you.  

#### [1:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4410) |  JOHN MUELLER: Cool. OK, I have to

jump off to another meeting soon. So maybe I'll pause here. I have another Hangout lined up for next Friday. So it's not the last one this year. And if any of you want to join then, feel free to jump on in. I think it'll probably be a little bit looser, because it's the last Friday before the holidays. We'll see.  

#### [1:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTIR8hM5pbw&t=4440) |  But thank you all for joining in.

It's been really interesting. Lots of good questions. Lots of feedback also to pass on to your teams. And I hope you all found this useful. And maybe we'll see each other again in one of the next Hangouts. AUDIENCE: Thanks, John. JOHN MUELLER: Thanks, everyone. [INTERPOSING VOICES] JOHN MUELLER: Bye. AUDIENCE: Bye, John. JOHN MUELLER: Bye.
