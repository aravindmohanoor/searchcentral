Before going any further, I'd like to ask you a question, do you create or manage content online and monetize it? (howling wind)

ensure you're creating sustainable monetized websites. There's a lot of names used to define who you are: website owner, business owner, SEO, blogger, webmaster, content creator, content manager, content marketer, publisher. You might identify with some, all, or none of these terms, and that's fine. Do you get what I mean? The web is full of terms, such as webmaster or publisher,

Sometimes, your activity on organic search might receive a manual action, and this could affect your site's performance. Others, your pages might be demonetized due to policy violations. I will not get into technical SEO here.

What I will talk about are those policies, guidelines, best practices, and tools that will help you have a sustainable, holistic online presence. And what do you mean by that?

I'll talk about tools, such as the Publisher Policy Center, Search console, and Site Kit-- useful when used together to improve your online presence.
