#### [0:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=0) |  JOHN MUELLER: All right. Welcome, everyone, to

today's Google Search Central SEO Office Hours Hangout. My name is John Mueller. I'm a search advocate at Google here in Switzerland. And part of what we do are these Office Hour Hangouts, where people can join in and ask their questions around Search, and we can try to find some answers. A bunch of things were already submitted on YouTube, so we can go through some of those. But if any of you want to get started with a first question, you're welcome to jump on in.  

#### [0:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=30) |  CHRISTIAN KUNZ: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi.

CHRISTIAN KUNZ: I hope it's OK if I start. I have a quick question regarding Core Web Vitals. Does it make a difference if a Core Web Vital is below the lower threshold, or is between the lower and the upper threshold? What I mean is if the Core Web Vital is yellow or green, does it make a difference for the ranking, beginning in May?  

#### [0:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=60) |  JOHN MUELLER: I don't know if we

even announced anything specific around that. My understanding is we see if it's in the green, and then that kind of counts as it's OK or not. So if it's in yellow, that wouldn't be kind of in the green, but I don't know what the final approach there will be.  

#### [0:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=90) |  Because there are a number of factors

that come together, and I think the general idea is if we can recognize that a page matches all of these criteria, then we would like to use that appropriately in Search for ranking. I don't know what the approach would be where it's like, there's some things that are OK and some things that are not perfectly OK, like how that would balance out. CHRISTIAN KUNZ: OK. Will there be some kind of information  

#### [0:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=120) |  before May about this? JOHN MUELLER: I

suspect so, yeah. I mean, the general guideline is that we would like to use these criteria to also be able to show a badge in the search results, which I think there have been some experiments happening around that. And for that, we really need to know that all of the factors are compliant. So if it's not on HTTPS, then essentially even if the rest is OK, then that wouldn't be enough.  

#### [0:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=150) |  CHRISTIAN KUNZ: OK, thanks. JOHN MUELLER: Sure.

JORGE HERNANDEZ: Good morning, John. I had a question in regards to knowledge panels. I'm working on a client's site, and I wanted to see what steps I can take to get a knowledge panel generated. Is there a certain schema, certain things I have to do to make that happen? JOHN MUELLER: We don't have any guidelines for how  

#### [0:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=180) |  to enable a knowledge panel. Essentially, that's

something that our algorithms try to pick up algorithmically automatically. And that's something where we take into account a number of different sources of information and to try to figure out what are the entities that are associated with this page, and how relevant are they and how should we be showing that in Search. So it's not that there's a specific meta tag that you need to do or a specific type of structured data that you need to add.  

#### [0:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=210) |  It's more that everything kind of needs

to align so that we can really recognize this page or this site is about this specific kind of entity. JORGE HERNANDEZ: OK. [INAUDIBLE] JOHN MUELLER: No fantastic answer, or no straightforward answer there. I know there are some people outside of Google who have been working all around kind of the knowledge panel things. Andy just linked to Jason Barnard.  

#### [0:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=240) |  He's definitely totally on top of this,

and he can probably give you a lot of tips on things that you can kind of work to make align. JORGE HERNANDEZ: OK, thank you. JOHN MUELLER: I think someone raised his hand. Davor? DAVOR SUBEK: Yeah. Hi, John. I have two questions, if it's not a problem. And the first one regards the duplicate content. Let's say we have a page that describes a bunch of cars,  

#### [0:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=270) |  right? So certain parts of the description

and content is the same. It is unique. We wrote it. And it's an information that users will find, but how will Google look at that? Will it be sort of negative score or something? Well [AUDIO OUT]. JOHN MUELLER: OK. So with that kind of duplicate content, it's not so much that there's a negative score associated  

#### [0:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=300) |  with it. It's more that if we

find exactly the same information on multiple pages on the web, and someone searches specifically for that piece of information, then we'll try to find the best matching page. So if you have the same content on multiple of your pages, then we won't show all of these pages. We'll try to pick one of them and show that. So it's not that there's any kind of negative signal associated with that. In a lot of cases, that's kind of normal  

#### [0:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=330) |  that you have some amount of shared

content across some of the pages. DAVOR SUBEK: [INAUDIBLE] JOHN MUELLER: --case, for example, is with e-commerce, if you have a product and someone else is selling the same product. Or within a website, maybe you have a footer that you share across all of your pages, and sometimes that's a pretty big footer. And technically, that's duplicate content, but we can kind of deal with that. So that shouldn't be a problem.  

#### [0:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=360) |  DAVOR SUBEK: Yeah, great. So the second

question would be about different languages. So we have, say, English and Spanish. And we have the same article, but it's translated. And we have great rankings in, say, Spanish-speaking area. And will that good ranking work for us so we get a better ranking in the US or English-speaking area? JOHN MUELLER: Not automatically. So we treat these as different pages,  

#### [0:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=390) |  and we would try to rank them

individually. However, what usually is done when you have a localized copy of your content is that you link between the localized versions. So you would link from the English version to the Spanish version, from the Spanish version to the English version. And based on these links, we would be able to distribute some of the signals associated with that good page, with that new language version that you also have.  

#### [0:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=420) |  So it's not like there's an automatic

kind of, your page in English will rank just as well as your page in Spanish. But some of that effort that you put in, if you link between those versions, that will be associated there. It's also the case that sometimes the competition in different languages is just very different. So you might have a really strong page in Spanish, and the English version is a much more competitive market than even if we forward some of the signals to your English version.  

#### [0:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=450) |  It might be very different with regards

to the competition in the search results. DAVOR SUBEK: OK. Thank you very much. SAIDUL HOQUE: Hi, John. JOHN MUELLER: Hi. SAIDUL HOQUE: I have two question about video. So when we add an image to a site, we usually use alt tag, we use title tag and caption so that Google can understand what is this image about. What can we do for video? If I upload or embed a video in my content, what can I do?  

#### [0:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=480) |  JOHN MUELLER: I don't know the names

offhand, but for video, we do have a type of structured data that you can use, and it also has fields for things like descriptions and title, I think, for videos as well. So that's something you can definitely use. But the more practical thing is kind of like with images as well-- if you have a caption right next to the video, if you have a heading on that part of the page, all of that  

#### [0:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=510) |  kind of applies to the embedded content

as well. So that's something that doesn't always require a special markup or special attributes to use. SAIDUL HOQUE: Second question is, is there any difference uploading a video or embedding a video, from SEO point of view? Like, if I embed a video, it means I am pulling the video from other website.  

#### [0:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=540) |  But when I upload it, it means

it is on my website. It means it is my content. So does Google differentiate in this way, or is all the same from SEO point of view? JOHN MUELLER: It's essentially the same. Like, it's very common that you have a separate CDN for videos, for example, and technically, that's kind of a separate website. And from our point of view, if that works for your users, if your content is accessible properly for Google for indexing, then that's perfectly fine.  

#### [0:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=570) |  SAIDUL HOQUE: Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Cool.

Bunch of people also have their hands raised. MIHAI APERGHIS: John, just wanted to follow up a bit on that duplicate content question. Obviously, what you said is perfectly accurate, but I think there are some cases where Google doesn't automatically merge two pages together for various reasons-- doesn't have enough signals,  

#### [0:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=600) |  or signals are conflicting. So in that

case, both pages might actually compete one against each other, and in that case, it kind of-- while there is no specific penalty or any algorithmic factor to kind of pull the site down, you're still at a disadvantage because you're trying to compete for the same thing with two pages. So I guess that it's still worth to try  

#### [0:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=630) |  to make sure to set up signals

so they do actually canonicalize properly, without hoping that Google kind of picks that up automatically. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, definitely. Yeah. ROBB YOUNG: John, can I just clarify that video question? JOHN MUELLER: Sure. ROBB YOUNG: I thought, unless my knowledge is a couple of years out of date, that if you used YouTube as your kind of host for the videos and you did a Google or a video search  

#### [0:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=660) |  of things, that YouTube would be the

source and not your page. Whereas if you use Vimeo or something else, then actually, your page shows as the source. Is that not still the case? JOHN MUELLER: It depends. ROBB YOUNG: Ah, excellent. JOHN MUELLER: It depends, the standard answer. Sorry. But I mean, with YouTube, you essentially have two video landing pages. You have the landing page on YouTube  

#### [0:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=690) |  and you have the landing page on

your site, and we kind of have to figure out which one of these pages to show. And it can happen that we show your site as the video result landing page, just because we have more information there, perhaps. It can also be that we show the YouTube landing page because maybe we have more signals or more information there. So that's something where it's not automatically the case that we would show the YouTube landing page. And some other video platforms also  

#### [0:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=720) |  have their own landing pages that they

create automatically. Some video hosting platforms don't do that at all. Essentially, that's kind of up to you there. ROBB YOUNG: So you're essentially by-- if you do it on something like Vimeo, which doesn't have a public-facing-- all the difference is you're not creating a competing video when you-- JOHN MUELLER: Yes. ROBB YOUNG: --create-- when you upload it, whereas with YouTube, if it's public, you're creating your own and the competing YouTube version,  

#### [0:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=750) |  and therefore-- JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. ROBB YOUNG:

You're competing with YouTube. JOHN MUELLER: Right. Yeah. I guess that's one thing that could play into that. It's also-- I mean, people sometimes search for videos on YouTube. So if you-- ROBB YOUNG: I've heard that. JOHN MUELLER: --over there, that might be kind of something you'd want to do anyway. But yeah, it is something where you kind of need to think about that a little bit as well. And it's not like 100% the same if you have the same video file  

#### [0:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=780) |  that you're hosting yourself or that someone

else is hosting for you without a landing page, or like you essentially have two video landing pages. Sometimes you also want to have two video landing pages because it's slightly different content or it attracts slightly different audience. ROBB YOUNG: OK. PRAVEEN SHARMA: Hi, John. Can I ask something? JOHN MUELLER: Sure. PRAVEEN SHARMA: OK.  

#### [0:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=810) |  So for example, there's a website that

is getting a good amount of search traffic. Now, I just wanted to know if that same website is getting traffic from some other channels, like traffic, social traffic, or some traffic from other blogs. So that non-search little traffic that the website is getting is some kind of positive signal for Google, like it finds that this website is getting a lot of traffic from director of social [? agenda, ?] so we should push this website in Search also so that searches  

#### [0:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=840) |  can find it easily? JOHN MUELLER: We

don't use that for SEO. So if-- like, I think it's great to-- from a website point of view, to diversify the different sources of traffic so that you have different places where people can find your site, different places how people can get to your site. But we don't use that for Search. So if you're active, I don't know, on Facebook or on other social media channels, and you get a lot of traffic there,  

#### [0:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=870) |  then that's kind of a way to

balance out some of the uncertainty, maybe, around Search or around Discover or around some of the other channels that you also use. Sorry. So kind of-- I think that diversification makes sense. It's something to work on, and it helps to make it a little bit safer with regards to your presence online, but it's not something that we take into account for Search. PRAVEEN SHARMA: Not directly or indirect-- like, for example,  

#### [0:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=900) |  a brand suddenly starts getting a lot

of [INAUDIBLE] traffic, so there's no impact on the search performance? JOHN MUELLER: No, no. I mean, indirectly, you might see something if people go to your site and think it's fantastic, and they share it with other people and we pick that up as a link, then maybe we could take that into account. But not directly. PRAVEEN SHARMA: Sure. Sure, thank you. JOHN MUELLER: OK, I see a bunch of people raised their hands, and I just found a place where I can see their names, so I'll just go through from the top of my list here.

#### [0:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=930) |  Benjamin. BENJAMIN: Hi, John, how are you?

JOHN MUELLER: Hi. BENJAMIN: Really long time listener, first time caller. It's an honor to be here. I remember the Matt Cutts days. But thank you for letting me in. I'm writing in, or I'm calling in because I purchased a website that has been around since 1998. It was owned by the same person until 2018 and-- can I paste it the-- am I allowed to paste it in the chat?  

#### [0:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=960) |  JOHN MUELLER: Sure. BENJAMIN: OK. It got

purchased, and then from what I can tell from all my SEO research, it got possibly turned into a PBN potentially, or just a really bad website. I purchased it and I've done everything I can to turn it around. I got in touch with the original owner, stalked the internet, found him. Been emailing him back and forth. Asked him why he sold it. He just said he got too old for it.  

#### [0:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=990) |  Updating all the content, added new UI,

added social profiles, which didn't exist. I'm seeing slight movements in traffic, which leads me to my question. I'm investing a lot of time into this. You know, money, too, but it's just really my time, and I'm putting my heart and soul into it, because I do think that this site needs to exist. I haven't found much on this topic. Am I wasting my time? Like, does Google say, oh, this was maybe potentially a PBN or they did spam me back. Oh, I did disavow as well.  

#### [0:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1020) |  Am I wasting my time? Can you

talk to the point of, are sites able to be turned around, especially under new ownership, new WHOIS information, new domain, new host as well? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I think the short answer is yes, you can turn it around. In general, the most common issue that we find is that maybe there is a manual action involved. And that's something you would see in Search Console. And I assume-- yeah, I assume you checked.  

#### [0:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1050) |  And if there's no manual action, that

essentially it's kind of a normal website. It's not that we would take into account any previous manual actions, like if some owner in between had a manual action, that's not something that we would take into account. So essentially, the way the site is now is the way that our algorithms are looking at it at the moment. And if you work to improve the site, and if there are other issues associated with the site that you work to improve, then that should improve over time.  

#### [0:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1080) |  BENJAMIN: There's no black stamp on it

forever type of thing? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. BENJAMIN: OK. Cool. All right, thanks, John. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. Right. ANDREW SYCHEV: John? JOHN MUELLER: Andrew. Let me just run through the names as I have them in the list. And then after that, I'll try to get through some of the submitted ones as well. But just to kind of make sure that we follow, like, who all is in the list. ANDREW SYCHEV: Yes, John, hello, thank you.  

#### [0:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1110) |  Well, my question is about the situation

when a site has an app connected to the site, and for mobile users, browsers offer them to download the applications showing some kind of banners from Google Play or App Store. This offer, as you may know, appear at the top of the site, and inevitably it creates layout shifting. And it's also hard to fix this shifting,  

#### [0:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1140) |  and I wanted to ask, what is

your opinion on this matter? Is Google OK with these situations? JOHN MUELLER: I assume you're specifically asking about the Cumulative Layout Shift from your Core Web Vitals? ANDREW SYCHEV: Sure, sure. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. So for that, I would focus on the metrics that you can pick up from the testing tools and from the real user data that you can pick up for the site.  

#### [0:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1170) |  So it's something where we don't explicitly

say, this specific kind of pop-up or banner is OK, or this specific banner is not OK. It's really just, you can test it and see what number comes out. And maybe there are things that you can do to improve that so that the number looks better, and where you can also look at the number and say, this is OK for me or this is something I need to improve. ANDREW SYCHEV: Well, but they do create this shifting.  

#### [0:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1200) |  And well, I don't know. It's not--

you can't control them, because it's not on your site. I mean, as I understand, it's not-- well, it's browsers. They just offer those-- [INAUDIBLE] I can't, I don't know, just close them, I mean, forever. But, well, it's not an option as well, a good option.  

#### [0:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1230) |  JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I don't know how

exactly that will look on a browser, so it's hard to say. But it's something where if you see that this is a problem for some of your pages, maybe there are ways that you can do to make it less visible on the important pages and maybe limit it to other pages, or do something such as allow the user to click on a button and then trigger this in the browser.  

#### [0:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1260) |  Something along those lines. ANDREW SYCHEV: OK,

OK. Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. Lee, I don't know if you asked before or already or still waiting. LEE ELLIOTT: Hey, John. Real quick, just two quick questions here. Piggybacking on the question about page speed earlier in Core Web Vitals, I work with a company, and they have a very authoritative page. We're more authoritative than our competitors that  

#### [0:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1290) |  are outranking us for a number of

keywords, and that has to do with some other factors that I'm dealing with right now. But we do have a slower page, significantly. However, I would say objectively, we have a more valuable experience. We offer a better product, that sort of thing, and we get more traffic than these other pages that we're ranking against. So my question is page speed used now  

#### [0:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1320) |  as a significant ranking factor that would

outweigh the content that we're providing and the user experience and that sort of thing? And will that get to be more of a factor come May and that sort of thing, when Core Web Vitals rolls out? JOHN MUELLER: We use speed on mobile at the moment. So that's something that kind of plays in a little bit there. And in May, I think the idea is to revamp how we look at that  

#### [0:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1350) |  and maybe-- I don't know. My guess

is that we will use that a little bit stronger as a signal. However, it's still the case that when we can recognize that someone is looking for something specific, or a page is particularly relevant to users, then that's what we plan to show. So for example, if someone is looking for your company, we wouldn't show some other page just because it's a little bit faster.  

#### [0:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1380) |  And that kind of means that if

you have a really strong page in your topic area, then probably that will be OK, even if it's a little bit slower. But yeah, it's really hard to kind of say, like, this is where the line will be drawn and this much is not strong enough or anything like that. LEE ELLIOTT: Cool. That makes sense. We're working on a number of things, so I'm not super worried about it, but it is one of those things where our engineering team is  

#### [0:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1410) |  sort of backed up and working on

getting these-- we have a very large website, so that's obviously one of the things that we're working on. My second question is about just subdomains. So my company has a blog that operates on a secondary subdomain, as opposed to a subfolder, and I'm just wondering, as far as ranking signals and stuff from Google, is that viewed as another domain entirely,  

#### [0:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1440) |  or do we have authority that's going

back and forth between the two? Obviously, we're linking between the two effectively and stuff. JOHN MUELLER: It depends. So in some cases, we will see this as part of the main site. In some cases, we will see it as something kind of separate. So for the most part, I wouldn't recommend just changing this just blindly and hoping that you'll get, like, a big advantage out of it. But rather, if you're thinking about consolidating things  

#### [0:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1470) |  on one domain, if it makes more

sense from kind of an infrastructure or tracking point of view, then I think all of that-- those things-- kind of point more in the direction of using subdirectories. But sometimes, it's also the same that kind of applies to subdomains, where you say infrastructure-wise, it's easier like this. Maybe you're using some CMS that needs to be on a separate subdomain. All of those things. So hard to say. LEE ELLIOTT: All right.  

#### [0:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1500) |  Thanks so much, John. JOHN MUELLER: Antonio.

ANTONIO DUARTE: Hi. It's an honor to ask you directly. Thank you so much. Question-- I have a page that's ranked for dozens of words in the top positions. And for a search for a group of searches, I [INAUDIBLE] for the second page of the results. The best thing to do is to include these terms  

#### [0:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1530) |  and talk about [INAUDIBLE] on the same

page, or create a specific page for those terms and link to do it? And I have a good and bad experience with both options, and that makes-- I'm really doubtful. What's your recommendation? If you want, I can do example for explain better my question.  

#### [0:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1560) |  JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I totally understand the

question, and I don't think I can give you an absolute answer. Because, like you said, sometimes it makes sense to separate things out on multiple pages, sometimes it makes sense to concentrate on a single page. I think it depends a lot on the user expectations. Maybe also the competition with regards to, like, would users be confused if they went to one general page  

#### [0:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1590) |  and they expect a kind of a

specific page, or would users also be OK with a general page that is ranking? For the most part, I think fewer pages makes sense, because you can make stronger pages. They're a little bit stronger with regards to kind of the competition. But at the same time, if you're specific about a certain topic, then that's a very well-targeted page.  

#### [0:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1620) |  So finding that balance, I think, is

really hard. My usual recommendation is for you to try it out and test it out and see what works well for you in your specific situation. ANTONIO DUARTE: Thank you so much. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I mean, it's not like a perfect answer, but hopefully gives you some ideas. At least there's no absolute answer. ANTONIO DUARTE: I know. I have this problem many years, and I will not  

#### [0:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1650) |  know exactly what to do because it's

Google. Thank you so much [INAUDIBLE]. You are incredible. JOHN MUELLER: Thank you. Stefan. STEFAN PIOSO: [INAUDIBLE]. So let me set the stage real quick. I work for a fairly large company, and I have similar subdomain content challenges as Lee does.  

#### [0:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1680) |  It's not exactly [INAUDIBLE] content, because the

context is slightly different-- there's a purchase aspect on one subdomain and a stream aspect on a different one. So we've been trying to tackle some indexation issues, where one subdomain actually has a lower traffic potential. We rank typically less well and so forth. So as I'm looking through GSC, one of my site maps--  

#### [0:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1710) |  looking through the excluded selection, and so

for one of the details, the duplicate submitted URL not selected as canonical, there's a huge number of URLs with that flag. And so as I started to look into some of the examples and then used the Inspect URL, I noticed that almost invariably, there was no URL included in the Google selected canonical. So I submitted a help article on the community,  

#### [0:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1740) |  and I got kind of a boilerplate

answer. And I was looking, as I was listening as we started the call, and it looks like that issue is fixed. So invariably, it seems like the URLs are now populated, but most of the examples that I found are completely offbase. So they have nothing to do with the actual query that the page should rank for. So my question is-- I guess the first question is-- how should one interpret the Google selected canonical  

#### [0:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1770) |  NA as a value? JOHN MUELLER: I

don't know. I think I saw something similar on Twitter recently, and I think that was a bug on our side. So in particular, if we index a page, then we always have a canonical. And if the tool says there is no canonical available, but it's indexed, then that would be kind of something conflicting on our side,  

#### [0:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1800) |  not necessarily something actionable on your side.

On the other hand, if it's not indexed, then it would be kind of normal that we say, well, we don't have a canonical associated with this URL, because it's not indexed, essentially. STEFAN PIOSO: Yeah. Well, the report I'm looking at would be indexed pages only, right? Or at least I've confirmed that they're indexed. JOHN MUELLER: OK. STEFAN PIOSO: Since we can reconfigure GSC for separate subdomains, my hypothesis  

#### [0:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1830) |  was that the alternative subdomain was actually

ranking, and you would just simply not include that URL because it's not on the same subdomain that's connected [INAUDIBLE] the GSC. JOHN MUELLER: No, I think-- I mean, I don't know what the specific bug there is, but it should be the case that even if it's on a different domain, if we say, like, a different URL on another domain is canonical for this one that you have, that we should show that. So it shouldn't be the case that we would just say, oh, we don't know, but actually we do know,  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wsrL6l2Fxvo/hq2.jpg)



#### [0:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1860) |  but we're just not-- don't want to

tell you about it. So that seems more like a bug on our side, rather than a sign that we use a different subdomain for that. STEFAN PIOSO: OK. Well, it looks as though the bug may have been fixed, but you may have introduced a new bug. JOHN MUELLER: Oh no. OK. STEFAN PIOSO: The canonicals seem completely offbase from the topic that should be canonicalized. JOHN MUELLER: OK. If you can drop some examples maybe in the chat here,  

#### [0:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1890) |  I can pick that up afterwards and

pass it on to the team. STEFAN PIOSO: Can do. Thank you much. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. Thanks. Angie, I think you also have your hand raised. ANGIE B: Hi, John. As always, thank you for doing this. So I'm doing a site move for a client, and I had a few questions about that. So we're changing the domain name. So they want to present the brand as more modern,  

#### [0:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1920) |  so just changing it to the acronym

of the full name. And we're not removing any pages, changing any content on pages or anything like that. So it's going to just be doing the redirects and then using the Change of Address tool in Search Console and et cetera. So pretty straightforward. But I was wondering if everything should be redirected? So like, the site map and robots.txt, specifically. Is it recommended to leave both the old site map up  

#### [0:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1950) |  and the new site map up, so

that Google's able to find all the redirects to the new site? Yes? OK. And then for the robots, I saw that there was-- in the Crawl Stats support document, I believe, there was-- it said that 200s and 400s were successful robot responses, and that 429s and 500s were unsuccessful. Did not mention anything about redirects. So is it recommended to leave that not redirected,  

#### [0:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=1980) |  so that Google is still able to

crawl from the old site? Or-- JOHN MUELLER: I don't think it matters, with regards to the redirect. I think in our site move documentation, at some point we had a recommendation that you have an empty robots.txt file on the old domain, just so that we can crawl all URLs and then find the redirect to a new one and recognize, oh, it's now blocked or it's a 404 or whatever.  

#### [0:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2010) |  My guess is that's more of kind

of like super small optimization with regards to crawling and not really necessary. So in particular, site map file and robots.txt files, they're files that are more like control files and not indexed anyway, so if they do or do not redirect, it doesn't really matter. With regards to all of the indexable content, that is something that is kind of important for us in the sense  

#### [0:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2040) |  that if we can recognize that a

site is only partially moving, then we'll kind of have to shift into a mode of like, oh, we have to figure out what actually changed here. Whereas if we can recognize the site has completely moved, all of the indexable content has moved, then we can shift into the mode of like, oh, we'll just transfer all of the signals in bulk to the new domain. ANGIE B: OK, yeah. So we are doing like a one-time switch, so we're not moving in sections. So we'll just literally be like flipping the switch,  

#### [0:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2070) |  and I guess the signals will start

processing-- will be processed right away? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. ANGIE B: OK. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, ideally, yeah. ANGIE B: OK. And then actually, on the note of site signals, because I know that these days, it's-- we talk about how pages are being ranked rather than domains as a whole, but how much of a factor are the site signals? Like, what I'm trying to ask is basically, say everything-- say we do everything perfectly.  

#### [0:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2100) |  We're not changing anything on the site,

either, so everything should be pretty much the same. Once Google is finished reprocessing everything, can we expect to have essentially the same sort of performance and everything as we had before? It's going to be on the same server as well. So the only thing that's changing is essentially just a domain name. Or what about new pages that go up on the site after the change? Because it's a new domain that has had no previous history,  

#### [0:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2130) |  could new pages be a little bit

at a disadvantage because Google has less site signals, or-- I guess basically, how much of the sites have to do with that? JOHN MUELLER: I think in an ideal situation, all of that will just transfer and it'll just continue working just like before. So we've been doing a number of analysis internally on site moves in particular, just to make sure that we're not missing anything,  

#### [0:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2160) |  that nothing kind of goes wrong with

most of the site moves. And for the most part, we can see that it clearly just completely transfers to a new domain. So if there's nothing kind of weird associated with the new domain and the website really does a clean move, then that should be completely fine. I think it's always something where you don't completely know what to expect, because it's a different domain.  

#### [0:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2190) |  You can't really try it out ahead

of time. So it's always a little bit of uncertainty involved. So my recommendation there is just to make sure that you're really tracking all of the details-- that you have a big spreadsheet with all of the checklist items to double check so that should anything weird happen, you can kind of be certain that we have all of these basics covered, and it's really something kind of obscure that you couldn't have known ahead of time. Or otherwise, you can go through the list  

#### [0:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2220) |  and see, oh, I forgot to set

the hreflang, or I forgot this specific thing, and then you can explicitly go in and fix that. ANGIE B: OK. Perfect. And then my last question was, so in the site move documentation, it does mention that we should expect rankings to fluctuate. And I was just kind of thinking about the process of how Google would reprocess those pages and how that would actually affect the ranking. So for example, is it more if I have a page  

#### [0:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2250) |  that on the old site that's currently

ranking for position 1 on a certain keyword, if we do the-- when we do the redirect, when Google discovers it, is there a period before, I guess, the crawling and sort of reindexing happens where it would actually drop out of the search results before being replaced by the new page if everything is good? Or is it-- if it crawls it and reprocesses it immediately?  

#### [0:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2280) |  Or sorry, or does the old page

just stay there until the new page is kind of reprocessed? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. So essentially, what happens there is we switch to canonical. So we would have the old page indexed. We would start seeing the redirect. We would follow the redirect, see that the same content is there, and then our systems would say, oh, it looks like it moved to this new URL, and we would just switch that over. It's not the case that it's like, it would fall out first,  

#### [0:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2310) |  and then be reindexed again. It's really

kind of like, oh, we see this connection, we see both of these pages, we can just switch it over to the new one. So it shouldn't be the case that there is, like, a hole with regards to traffic. But usually, with all site moves, you have this period of there's some things associated with the old site, some things associated with the new site, and it takes a little bit of time to shift the majority of things over. In a lot of the site moves that I  

#### [0:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2340) |  looked at for double checking, this is,

I don't know, a period of a couple of days, maybe a week or so, where it just kind of like fluctuates a little bit until it settles down again in kind of a similar state with a new domain. ANGIE B: OK. Thank you very much. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. We have tons of stuff submitted as well. But it seems like, I don't know, with the hands and such, it seems to be working fairly well. So I'm going to focus on questions from here,  

#### [0:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2370) |  and maybe add some comments to the

questions that were submitted so that those don't completely get lost. All right. I think Kadu, if I got your name right. KADU DE CARVALHO: Yeah, that's right. Thank you, John, for this opportunity. And my question is more about Web Vitals. We have a application platform and many of our requests  

#### [0:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2400) |  are made from [INAUDIBLE] users. And basically,

we try to log into the users different from all other users. And the same page, we load a bit more stuff on [INAUDIBLE] for a lot of the users, and this makes the page much more deficient on Web Vitals. My question is, how concerned I have to be about my [INAUDIBLE] users and this page that we serve for them?  

#### [0:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2430) |  JOHN MUELLER: If you have the same

URL that is publicly accessible as well, then it is very likely that we can include that in kind of the aggregate data for Core Web Vitals, in the real user metrics side of things, and then we might be counting that in as well. So if the logged in page exists in a public forum, then we might think some users are seeing this longer page, perhaps, or kind  

#### [0:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2460) |  of more complicated page. And we would

count those metrics. Whereas if you had separate URLs and we wouldn't be able to actually index those separate URLs, then that seems like something that we will be able to separate out. I don't know what exact guidance here is from the Core Web Vitals side, though, so I would double check specifically with regards to Chrome in the CrUX help pages  

#### [0:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2490) |  to see how that would play a

role in your specific case. KADU DE CARVALHO: Thank you, John. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. Darcy. DARCY BURK: John, how's it going? [INAUDIBLE] JOHN MUELLER: Good, how are you? How are we doing? DARCY BURK: OK, so I have a question kind of along the lines of some of the subdomain questions that people have been asking. So if-- because you kind of said, I think if I heard your answer correctly, there might-- there is some times when that can make sense.  

#### [0:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2520) |  So I'm wondering if this situation makes

sense and what are the potential risks involved here, where the site is going to exist in two parts. One is like the content focused part of the site and then the other is the e-commerce focused part of the site, and so you would have shop.mysite.com and then your e-commerce site on the subdomain. Would you recommend-- a couple of questions. Would you recommend that strategy?  

#### [0:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2550) |  What are the risks involved? And then,

how much GameStop stock do you own? JOHN MUELLER: [LAUGHS] Oh man. I don't know about the last one. That's so weird. Such a weird situation. Throws me off completely. Yeah, so I think-- to kind of back up a bit, we regularly talk with the search leaders about subdomains  

#### [0:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2580) |  versus subdirectories and call them, like, SEOs

are so obsessed about subdirectories and such. And they always tell us they should just use whatever makes sense. Like, our system should be able to deal with subdomains and subdirectories essentially in the same way. So I think there are some more second-order effects that some people are seeing there, but I don't think it's something where I'd say, you will automatically have a bonus if you go to subdirectories or if you  

#### [0:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2610) |  go to subdomains kind of thing. So

if you have your shop on a separate subdomain and that's what works well for you with regards to tracking and all of that, then I would try to keep that. I don't see a problem with moving that over or trying to find a way to do, like, a reverse proxy and move that to a subdirectory. DARCY BURK: So do you think they can-- because, I mean, I guess always the concern, right, is the two separate site situation  

#### [0:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2640) |  and trying to rank-- because you want

both to rank, et cetera. You know, the problem that we have here is a technology problem where the the customer wants to use Shopify for the e-commerce side, but not for the content side, right? I mean, Shopify can't install on a subfolder. So you feel that it still could work just fine? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. DARCY BURK: Would Google decide to link those and consider them  

#### [0:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2670) |  one site, or are they always going

to be considered two sites no matter what? JOHN MUELLER: It depends a little bit. I think in a situation where you just have two subdomains, then probably we would treat those as separate sites. If you have a lot of different subdomains, then we might see like, oh, they're using wild card subdomains as categories, for example, then that would be a clear sign that actually this is one site. We should treat that as one thing. I think in a case where you have content on one site, one subdomain, and the shop on the other,  

#### [0:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2700) |  I really don't see a problem also

with competing against each other, because usually people come with one intent. And if they want the product, they'll find the product pages. If they want information, they'll find the informational pages. It's not that these are competing against each other or otherwise kind of annoying each other in Search. DARCY BURK: OK, cool. Thank you. JOHN MUELLER: What was the other question? DARCY BURK: It was the GameStop stock. It was a joke. JOHN MUELLER: A joke. DARCY BURK: [LAUGHS]  

#### [0:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2730) |  JOHN MUELLER: Oh, OK. OK, hoo. All

right. DARCY BURK: Thanks. JOHN MUELLER: Erik. Thanks. ERIK BROCKO: Can you hear me? JOHN MUELLER: Yes. ERIK BROCKO: OK, hello. Hey, thanks for having me, and thanks for doing these sessions. It's great. It's really good. I have a few questions regarding Search. OK, so first of all, we had a review of iPhone that came out, and for some reason, it ranked lower than our first impressions article ever  

#### [0:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2760) |  did that covered reviews from other magazines

all over the world. But we are really strong locally in our country. And we had a review, like really, really good review, and it was below our article that covered the first impressions. After one or two months, we noticed that we were seeing the review schema with the rating and stuff and the price, so we added this to the article, and then after a couple hours, it  

#### [0:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2790) |  ranked above the first impressions article that

we did before. Is that possible? JOHN MUELLER: I don't think that would be directly related. So in particular, the rich results or the structured data is something that we use for the rich results in the search results. It's not something we would use as a ranking factor itself. What might have happened is that you changed the page enough that our system said, oh, we need to reconsider how  

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wsrL6l2Fxvo/hq3.jpg)



#### [0:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2820) |  we kind of index this page, and

then based on that, we kind of reconsidered the ranking. But that shouldn't be related to adding structured data to a page, essentially. So it's not the case that every review needs to have review structured data on it. ERIK BROCKO: That's what I thought, OK. So-- and also with this, do the missing fields in schema or in the review type--  

#### [0:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2850) |  do the missing fields then skew description,

aggregate rating, and ISBN. Do these matter if they are missing? Because I see that Google only requires the three-- the price, the name of the product, and-- I don't know, I forgot-- the rating. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. So if you have the requirements covered, then we would show that in the rich results, and the rest are really more optional. At least as far as I know, it's not the case that we would rank things more if you have more of the fields  

#### [0:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2880) |  filled out. ERIK BROCKO: OK, OK. And

does Google-- I know that you-- in search results, that Google only uses algorithms that find content on the site. But do meta tags description and keywords matter at all for the results? JOHN MUELLER: We don't use the keywords meta tag at all. So that, you can do whatever you want with it. I don't think any search engine uses that anymore.  

#### [0:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2910) |  The description we use as a guide

for the description or the snippet that we show in Search. It's not always purely from the description meta tag, but for a lot of cases, it is something that we use there. So if you have a specific snippet that you want to have shown, then definitely make sure that's in the description. But we wouldn't use that as a ranking factor. It's more that you're showing users what this page is about, and maybe they will click through more if they understand it a little bit better.  

#### [0:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2940) |  But it's not-- ERIK BROCKO: Of course.

JOHN MUELLER: --that it would rank higher because of that. ERIK BROCKO: Yeah, I see all that. And we received an email-- it's actually yesterday and today for our web page for our Search Console, that you launched a new service or something that grouped all the subdomains and subdirectories and HTTPS into one domain. And so we verified the domain and everything, and we still don't see the data that we see for our HTTPS WWW  

#### [0:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=2970) |  site. Will this show up eventually? JOHN

MUELLER: Yes, yes. The data sometimes takes up to a week to be completely visible in Search Console, so some features are a little bit faster, some features take a little bit more time. But that's kind of normal that it takes a little bit of time to be visible. And I think with this message in particular, we sent it out when we noticed that sites are not completely verified in Search Console. That maybe you have traffic to the HTTPS version  

#### [0:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3000) |  and you have HTTP verified. That's something

we just wanted to make sure that people are aware that they're not looking at the full picture. So with the domain verification, that's all kind of covered automatically. ERIK BROCKO: I see. Perfect. And we also noticed that our site maps were not indexing properly or loading properly in Search Console. And it was fine for a few years. I mean, no problems. But last week, we noticed that for some reason, the Search Console couldn't load our site  

#### [0:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3030) |  maps from the site.index. We have an

index file with all the site maps [INAUDIBLE] and it loaded most of them, but the ones that matter the most, the posts, they just couldn't load it. So is that something we can do something about? JOHN MUELLER: I would probably post about that in the Help forum with the specific site map URL so that someone can take a look there. And if it is something that's more on Google's side,  

#### [0:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3060) |  then usually the folks in the Help

forum can help to escalate that to us. ERIK BROCKO: I think it's a bug, because we added some parameters into the URL and it loaded fine. So it shouldn't be-- it should be better, obviously. OK, and then last question. Sorry for that. Then we had a review for AirPods Max. We're the first in the country to have both the product and the review, and I just don't know why, we still don't show up in the results.  

#### [0:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3090) |  And it's really annoying, because we spend

a lot of time and effort into the-- for the review, and we don't show up in the results. So can you-- JOHN MUELLER: I don't know. ERIK BROCKO: Can you sort it out? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah, I don't know. I can't make you rank automatically higher. ERIK BROCKO: Of course not. JOHN MUELLER: So the one thing I would watch out for is if the page is indexed or not. If it's not indexed, then usually that's more of a technical thing that you can work to improve. But if it is indexed and it's just not ranking the way that you want, it's really hard for us to say,  

#### [0:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3120) |  this is a big problem or not

a big problem. So what I would also do there is maybe post in the Help forum and kind of the specifics of the URL that you're using, the queries that you're looking at, especially if you're looking at a specific country-- maybe those details as well. And they can take a look at that there and escalate that to us if appropriate. ERIK BROCKO: That's what-- JOHN MUELLER: A lot of these ranking questions are really tricky, because it's often,  

#### [0:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3150) |  like, which page should we show. It's

like, everyone wants to be first. ERIK BROCKO: Of course. OK, thank you very much. Thank you and have a good day all of you. JOHN MUELLER: Thanks. All right, Marc. MARC OPITZ: Yeah, hi, thanks, John. This is more like a European focused question. We have a cookie content layout. Obviously, it's a [INAUDIBLE] form sending out the correct strings and everything. So my first question was I think, if I'm not mistaken,  

#### [0:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3180) |  Google mentioned that loading layers like these

would be recognized and they will not be added to the Page Speed Index. However, when I do check the domain on the Page Speed Index Insight tool, it is recognized, and if it's-- found to be improvable. However, we use probably the fastest CMP on the market, so there's really nothing to improve here.  

#### [0:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3210) |  Just a question-- would Google go back

and take it out of consideration, also with reference to May, or what do you think? JOHN MUELLER: Essentially, we'd be able to take that out with regards to indexing the content. But from a speed point of view, we would not differentiate between this kind of banner or any other kind of banner. So essentially, from a speed point of view, it is something we would see as something that users would  

#### [0:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3240) |  see when they go to the page,

and that would be taken into account there. So I don't think, at least as far as I know, that we would have any logic to say, oh, this is a proper cookie banner, therefore we will ignore that it's slow or that it causes layout shifts. MARC OPITZ: Well, there's that list available on officially registered CMPs, right? So we're doing something that's legally obliged. And we're just wondering because in theory, a competitor who  

#### [0:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3270) |  is not using any of those layers

might have a page speed advantage, and when page speed is becoming more and more important, it's just more like out of curiosity, how you deal with that. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. My understanding is we would see that as a part of a page. So that would be something. If it's slowing down the loading of your page, then  

#### [0:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3300) |  that would be something we would take

into account and say, this page is slower than maybe the same page without that specific setup. But I think another aspect that kind of plays into that as well is that you're competing with sites that have similar setups. So it's less a matter of, like, we will not show your site at all in Search, but essentially other people have the same kind of struggles and need to figure out the same kind of thing.  

#### [0:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3330) |  So it's kind of like you're competing

with other sites that have the same problem, so it makes it a little bit more even. But obviously, in the situation that you mentioned, where if someone is, let's say, I don't know, let's call it rogue and doesn't do any kind of banner at all, then that would be something that we would say, well, maybe this is a faster page, but maybe the other page is a little bit slower, but it's a better page, or better fitting page for the user. And then we would still rank that there. So it's something where we do take speed and usability  

#### [0:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3360) |  into account for rankings, but it's not

the only thing. It's like, the content is still by far, I think, the biggest aspect there. MARC OPITZ: OK. Thank you very much. JOHN MUELLER: Sure. Raymond. Let's see. RAYMOND BORHAN: Hi, John. So I also posted this question to the comments for the video. We have a site with a mega menu that has over 1,000 links.  

#### [0:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3390) |  It used to be that this mega

menu, back in 2018, would only load upon user action. So when a user hovered above the navbar, AJAX probably load those links. At some point in 2018, we added those static links in. And I know correlation isn't causation, but around that same time, we saw a big drop in our search traffic. And now we are now contemplating removing these links from our navbar static links and going back to links  

#### [0:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3420) |  that only load upon user action with

the AJAX call. We are, nevertheless, maintaining a clear path to all of these links on relevant pages. So we'll still have a clear crawl path to those links, but only on the relevant pages, rather than having these links on every page. You know, these [INAUDIBLE] mega menu for everything. So we're wondering, what could possibly be the impact or ramifications of removing these 1,000  

#### [0:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3450) |  mega menu links or static links, even

though we are still retaining a crawl path to all of these links on relevant pages? JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. I think on the one hand, it's kind of hard to say, because I don't know how the rest of your site is structured. So if, for example, these 1,000 pages are all of your pages, then it would be very different compared to, say, these 1,000 pages are your categories, and you have a million kind of subcategories or something  

#### [0:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3480) |  like that. But in general, what you're

looking at from a change point of view is going from a more of a flat site structure to more, I don't know, deeper site structure. I don't know what the official name is. RAYMOND BORHAN: [INAUDIBLE] siloed [INAUDIBLE].. JOHN MUELLER: Yeah. And that's something where sometimes, that can definitely make sense. So it's something-- we sometimes see  

#### [0:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3510) |  folks kind of obsessing about limiting the

crawl depth, for example, and trying to make it so that Googlebot can crawl to all pages in a very quick time. And to some extent, I think that makes sense. On the other hand, kind of more the top down approach or pyramid structure helps us a lot more to understand the context of individual pages within the site. So in particular, if we know this category is associated with these other subcategories, then that's  

#### [0:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3540) |  a clear connection that we have between

those parts. And that definitely helps us to understand how these things are connected, how they work together, a little bit better. Whereas if it's very flat, then we think, oh, all of these are equally important, and we don't really know which of these are connected to each other. So from my point of view, I think for a lot of sites, it makes sense to have more of a pyramid structure.  

#### [0:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3570) |  But at the same time, you don't

want it to be such that it's like you have to click through a million times to actually get to the actual content. You need to have, I don't know, some reasonable number of clicks, essentially, to get to the content. RAYMOND BORHAN: I see. And we are trying to-- we are an e-commerce site, so there is a case to be made for us having mega menus. However, we just want to-- that not to show up as static links that would get crawled, but still make it available to the user as to a user action,  

#### [1:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3600) |  for a user-induced action, rather than just

having them there as static links. But we still are all looking to have a siloed site with a more [? parameteral ?] structure, rather than something that has-- where we indiscriminately have 1,000 links on every page. So yeah, we've been-- we've talked to a number of SEO firms and they told us, well, if you do this,  

#### [1:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3630) |  then it can create-- negatively impact your

site that all of a sudden, these 1,000 links that you had up to all these pages are gone. And it's not really true, because we are trying to retain those links, but only on relevant pages. But [INAUDIBLE] they told don't do it, because if you lose all these 1,000 links to all the other things, that's bound to have a negative effect. And I'm wondering if an empirical statement like that could be made. JOHN MUELLER: I don't think it would always have a negative effect. I do think if you make it too deep,  

#### [1:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3660) |  then that makes it harder for us

to crawl and harder for us to pass the signals around. But it's not the case that a superflat structure is going to be better than a kind of reasonable pyramid structure. So personally, I would try to aim for more of a pyramid structure just to make it so that it's easier for us to understand the context of the individual pages and to forward the signals into kind of related areas easier.  

#### [1:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3690) |  But it's also something which is-- it's

a very significant change on a site like that. So it's something where I understand that it makes sense to kind of get more input on the options, maybe even to test things out, like you take one category and say, I'll try it here and see what happens with regards to crawling, with regards to indexing, with regard to ranking-- all of these things. Because it is quite a big step when you change your site from kind of a superflat  

#### [1:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3720) |  layout to more of a pyramid layout.

RAYMOND BORHAN: Cool, thank you. JOHN MUELLER: Let me pause the recording here maybe for a moment. I'll be here for a little bit longer so we can still answer some of the questions that are remaining. But if you're watching this recording, thanks. Thanks for watching along. I hope you found this useful, and I'll be sending out the next batch of Hangouts probably on Monday or so, so for next week  

#### [1:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsrL6l2Fxvo&t=3750) |  and the week after that. All right

Thanks a lot. And let me just pause.
